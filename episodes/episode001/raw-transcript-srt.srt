Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast, a podcast all about early-stage web

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,320
developers and the mentors and teachers that helped him along the way.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,880
Today, we are going to have a chat with Ricky Smit.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,880
He is some of the people that joined the Mycelium Network very early on and has been

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,240
pretty active on the community.

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,560
So I thought it only appropriate to have him as one of the first guests.

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,280
Hey, Ricky.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,720
Welcome to the podcast.

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:26,880
Thanks for having me.

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,760
It's a pleasure.

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,960
So I've seen some of these questions to you beforehand, just so you can be a

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,640
little bit more prepared, but we'll off the cuff some things here and there.

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:39,920
No pressure.

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,680
It's just an informal chat to just learn what works, what doesn't work,

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,600
what's the challenges you're facing and how the mentors that I speak

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,200
with can potentially help.

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,120
So to get us off to a start, tell us a bit about your background.

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,320
What did you do up to now and what made you look into getting into software

19
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,840
or web development specifically?

20
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,400
Well, since I was born and raised here in Pretoria, my uncle has been

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,160
very heavy into technology.

22
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,560
So ever since I lived, I was little, I remember standing by him, seeing

23
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,160
what he's doing and that intrigued me from a young age.

24
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,520
And then throughout high school, I had the opportunity to take IT and

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,720
actually discover the love for coding.

26
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,320
And I had a chance to get all of the fundamentals down.

27
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,760
But as soon as that all ended, I had to basically walk out into a job.

28
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:43,680
I worked in retail for a hardware shop.

29
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,680
I did what I had to do to survive, but it's not what I wanted to do.

30
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,040
I always had this feeling like I want to do something else.

31
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,160
The first course I had with you, actually, I actually realized how much

32
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,600
I love web development above stuff like app development or server working

33
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,200
or security, stuff like that.

34
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,080
I actually realized I really love working with web, creating pages,

35
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,640
designing new things.

36
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,320
I just fall in love with it.

37
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,160
That's great.

38
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,400
So yeah, I'm looking to study now.

39
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,120
At the end of the day, I would like to be a full stack developer,

40
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,760
being able to do everything and anything that is necessary.

41
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,080
So it's good too.

42
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,680
I think it's good to have that as a goal.

43
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,160
But what I do find is they talk about being T-shaped in terms of your skills.

44
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,960
So you have a broad knowledge base, but then you have something that you focus on.

45
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,760
For myself personally, I do know about backend development and I've done stuff

46
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,080
and I keep doing stuff in that region, like Python a little bit and even

47
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,560
databases, like the old relational kind of stuff, I say old, but people definitely

48
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,520
still use relational databases today.

49
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,320
But I definitely have the T of my T-shape is definitely focused on frontend

50
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,840
development and like, as they say, front of the front.

51
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,280
So I like the design aspects and I like the CSS and making things look good

52
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,760
and work well and performance, accessibility.

53
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,120
Those things are really important to me.

54
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,920
So I think it's good to have that broader perspective of what happens in the

55
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:30,000
industry, but it's always nice to have something that's more your focus area.

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,840
Be a really go deep, as they say that.

57
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,440
So you have this breadth and then you have depth in a certain area.

58
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,160
But that's great.

59
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,400
Yeah.

60
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,920
I know for myself also, I also got into web development from a music background.

61
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,720
For me, the nice thing about web in the early days with Flash and that was still

62
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,360
around was that it had this thing where I could like take the musical aspect and

63
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,600
the design aspect and like take a little bit of programming and like mix them all.

64
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,760
And because we used to make these Flash intros, which are like little movies that

65
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,920
used to play before you'd actually go into the website, really the little movie

66
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,720
with like text and animation and whatnot.

67
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,720
And then it would say, click to enter.

68
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,960
That used to be a huge thing back in the day.

69
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,840
So, you know, I understand like starting something and then being bitten by this

70
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,000
web thing and really digging into it.

71
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,480
So is there something you wanted to expand though?

72
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,720
I must say I am more interested in the front end side of things.

73
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,680
It feels like I would like to know the back end part to make things simpler if

74
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,560
you do get stuck.

75
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,880
But I must definitely say I'm more interested in front end development.

76
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,120
I don't really find PHP interesting.

77
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,280
I hate SQL.

78
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,560
We had to do some in high school.

79
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,320
I absolutely hate it.

80
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:44,560
Yeah.

81
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,440
Yeah, no, it's, it's a journey.

82
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,440
It is for sure.

83
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:55,280
So now we know you about your background and how you came to where you are and

84
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,280
what you're looking to do for your future.

85
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,400
Like you mentioned, one of the main things you need to do is learn.

86
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:07,280
So as you're learning, what, which resources have you like really come to depend on?

87
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,200
I've got three, actually four now.

88
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,920
I really like the input I should get from you.

89
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,400
If we get together, I have a chat about things that's going on and places to find

90
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,600
things to help the development further.

91
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,960
VS code has gotten very essential for me.

92
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,240
It is, I try it sublime text.

93
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,920
It is very bare-boned and feels like amazing if you have a laptop and

94
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,080
javelin round and you have a moment to open up and edit something.

95
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,920
And it's also very, very, it's a lot smaller than VS code.

96
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,400
So it's easier for me to carry around on a flash drive.

97
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,800
So having Git actually is amazing just using GitHub in general because where I am,

98
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,800
I would be able to download my current project.

99
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,600
I'd be able to open it in sublime and work on it.

100
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,800
But when I'm home, I prefer to use GitHub to download my updates and everything and

101
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,880
then work through the VS code.

102
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,360
And funny enough, YouTube is very essential to me.

103
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,960
I struggled to certainly read through a document of pages and pages.

104
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,000
I just can't.

105
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,560
So for me, I like YouTube, someone telling you do this, this, and this, and then they

106
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,200
type it out.

107
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,000
So you can actually pause and go do it yourself and then rinse and rinse until you get the

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,040
hang of whatever you're doing.

109
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

110
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,880
Yeah, no, I agree.

111
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,680
There's definitely different modalities that work better for some people.

112
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,920
That is why with the 150 days of HTML thingy that I'm putting together, I have incorporated

113
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:51,280
video into the pages now so that if you're more of a video person, you can like listen

114
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,240
to me talk through the content, but you have the content just below you as a reference.

115
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,480
I think that that for me is something that I have understood more and more is giving

116
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,400
people different ways to consume the same content because not everybody learns the same

117
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,120
way.

118
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,320
Is there anybody specifically on YouTube that you want to give a shout out to that you find

119
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,520
is particularly good?

120
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,680
Now you're asking me a question half.

121
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,640
I do know his name.

122
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,320
I just want to retrieve it.

123
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:28,080
If I remember correctly, it's Mosch and he has a lot of coding tutorials online.

124
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:34,800
His entire teaching style, the way he talks, explains, all of the little graphs and things

125
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,960
he uses is amazing.

126
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,480
I just really like learning this from this guy in particular.

127
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,480
That's great.

128
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,720
I'm trying to just get his name right now.

129
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,880
If I remember correctly, it's Mosch.

130
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:48,960
Sounds familiar.

131
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,640
I think you've mentioned him to me as well.

132
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:57,440
One big problem I'm actually running into as a new developer is finding the information

133
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:57,840
I need.

134
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,600
So more often than not, I find myself asking what's next.

135
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,560
I don't know what to learn from here on out.

136
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:19,200
Unfortunately, I do rely on free resources at the moment because not currently it's running

137
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,240
from paycheck to paycheck.

138
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:27,040
So I simply do not have the means to pay for courses quite yet, especially the online stuff

139
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,960
gets really expensive really quickly.

140
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,040
Yes, that's true.

141
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,200
There we go.

142
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,640
I found his name, Mosch Hanadani.

143
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,480
All right, cool.

144
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,960
We should link him up in the, send me the link afterwards and I'll put it in the show

145
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:48,000
notes and I'll probably reach out to him and see if I can do an interview with him on the

146
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,560
podcast.

147
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,360
Yeah, no, all of those things are very true.

148
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,240
And I think what's gotten nice is something that's starting to get a little more traction

149
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,160
is the idea of purchasing power parity pricing.

150
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,520
That's always a hard one to say.

151
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:10,080
The idea being that depending on where you live, they will geofence the content, but

152
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,560
you will pay a smaller and lower amount based on where you live.

153
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,320
Somebody that's really great with us is somebody like Ken C. Dodds.

154
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,640
He's got all those courses about React and testing and all that kind of stuff.

155
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:29,360
And if I, living in South Africa, purchases one of these courses, I get a 60% discount

156
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,200
immediately just because of purchase parity pricing.

157
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:39,120
So I think that's something that the industry as a whole should consider more widely because

158
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,760
then they can make it, because I understand why people ask money for courses.

159
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,840
It's a heck of a lot of work.

160
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,880
And if you want to do it well, it's especially a lot of work.

161
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,600
And for some people, this is how they make a living.

162
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,840
But it is tough when you come from a third world country or you're just starting out

163
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,920
and you're still finding your feet and you don't have a bunch of money to invest yet.

164
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,880
It is hard.

165
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,800
And there's all kinds of other interesting things developing around that idea as well

166
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,200
with some academies and stuff in the United States exploring a different way of paying

167
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,880
for your courses.

168
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,400
But that is everything.

169
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:22,800
I think the thing that I get from you is that one big thing that's missing is a roadmap

170
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,680
that you can look at, which points you at specific learning material based on where

171
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,280
you are along your path.

172
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,640
And also which path you're on.

173
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,240
Are you on a backend path?

174
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,520
Are you on a full stack path or are you more on a front end path?

175
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:42,560
Because you'll have different milestones and different learning material needs there.

176
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,640
So I think that is something that we should look into, see if there are some resources

177
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,280
to help there.

178
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,880
Yeah, no, definitely.

179
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,720
Because being in the front end developer, I've been working, learning, and then I reach

180
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,960
a point and I just look at everything online.

181
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,160
What now?

182
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,680
Do I just invest my time into CSS?

183
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,200
Do I just continue HTML, Java?

184
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,840
What next?

185
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,640
What do I need to do?

186
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,520
What do I need to find?

187
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,520
So I ended up spending two to three hours searching for stuff to learn, running out

188
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,480
of steam, learning for an hour or two, and then continuing with my day rather than having

189
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,600
to go somewhere and spend those hours more, an hour finding this and this and this is

190
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,240
what I need.

191
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,360
And then two to three hours of learning whatever needs to come next.

192
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:32,880
Yeah.

193
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,600
Yeah.

194
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,240
I think communities such as the Mycelium network can also help there if we, especially if we

195
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:46,800
can get some more mentors to join our Discord server and then where we're talking about

196
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,720
the idea of having some meetups virtually and in person where possible.

197
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:57,120
I think that'll help because there you can pose these kinds of questions and, you know,

198
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,120
talk with other people and often more often than not somebody else is being where you

199
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,120
are and they can say, Oh, I actually found this thing and it can kind of help you on

200
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,600
your way.

201
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,320
So I think investing in community and joining in on these communities and being active,

202
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,960
I think is one of the ways that we can start solving this roadmap problem, but we have

203
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:24,560
to get people from then on learning and people who are teaching in the same place.

204
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,680
A nice mixture of two so you don't have too many mentors and too little.

205
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,520
So yeah, definitely.

206
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,840
And it's, as quite a shy guy, it's almost very difficult for me to enter the community.

207
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,040
Yes.

208
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:45,520
I don't know why I've always had this thing about online communities, even during my

209
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,200
leisurely hours when I have gaming and stuff.

210
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,160
I would not communicate with both people on the server.

211
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,160
I just find it strange, you can say.

212
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,360
So that was quite difficult for me.

213
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,800
But what I found is you just jump in, find one thing you like, just drop a comment and

214
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:06,000
see what happens because after that first comment you find it's actually not that

215
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,280
intimidating or scary.

216
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,560
You can just go.

217
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,120
Yeah, that's very true.

218
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,400
And a lot of that comes down to also the people running the community, right?

219
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:21,680
If you're focused and you start off with good community guidelines and you clearly

220
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:28,000
enforce them, it helps a lot because there are, you know, bundles out there that just

221
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,560
want to come and, you know, sour the pot.

222
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,560
But as long as there's people that have their finger on the pulse and can quickly

223
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,760
pick that up and make sure that those people are either kicked or reprimanded in a way

224
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,480
that they understand that that kind of behavior is not welcome and their continued

225
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,000
participation is going to hinge very heavily on them changing their attitude.

226
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,200
I think that is important and it's something that unfortunately has been a little rough

227
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,720
on the internet, to put it mildly.

228
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,200
Places got very toxic very quickly.

229
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:08,720
And for me and you, it might be a little bit easier than for some genders and people of

230
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,120
different races and ethnicities.

231
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,440
For them, it's even harder to really feel comfortable in these groups.

232
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,640
So, you know, big challenges that we have, but as long as we acknowledge them, then at

233
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,160
least we're in the right direction.

234
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,480
I think if you've mentioned a lot of, you've touched on a lot of the stuff from this, the

235
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,920
next question I had in mind, but I'm going to pose it anyway, just in case there's

236
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,040
anything else.

237
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,320
So having talked about all of these resources and stuff.

238
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,400
So clearly there's a bunch of things that don't work, but there are things that work.

239
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,040
But if there's anything else that you feel on that doesn't work to the great side that

240
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,840
you want to highlight.

241
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,440
The work that not works so great is a bit difficult.

242
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,760
Does not work so great.

243
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,320
The only thing I'm personally really stuck on is feeling lost.

244
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,840
You're this drop that falls into an ocean.

245
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,360
I'm just going to told swim.

246
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,960
You don't know where you're going.

247
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,760
You don't know which way.

248
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,960
You don't know if you should swim down or up or what's going on.

249
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,760
That's the only thing that's really missing for me.

250
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,320
But that said, I do have you as a mentor as well.

251
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,280
So I don't feel that lost.

252
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,200
If I get stuck, I can meet up and just say, hey, listen, this is going on.

253
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,800
How can we resolve this?

254
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:22,560
Yeah.

255
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:30,320
So clearly that's the important thing to have and to nurture is this whole mental relationship.

256
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,720
So do you think that there's a lot of value there that I think a lot of people miss?

257
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,400
Yeah.

258
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,360
That's so bad to say.

259
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,240
That's definitely something that's missing is finding someone you can ask a question

260
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:49,200
to, to just ask, how do you add a heading in HTML and not him having a laugh at you

261
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,200
and just saying, oh, okay, let's help you.

262
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,120
This is how we do it.

263
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,160
This is why we do it.

264
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,920
But I did not feel that personally because I did start my journey with you.

265
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:06,560
So I had that from the get go, but I can really see that being missing in a lot of people's

266
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,160
startup, you can often have same.

267
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,440
Yeah.

268
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:09,600
Yeah.

269
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,320
No, for sure.

270
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,120
That's true.

271
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:19,120
I mean, I, I've been there also, and I know that I actually searched widely to try and

272
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,200
find, is there any like networks or mentorship programs or anything like that, that you can

273
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,680
join?

274
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:31,920
And there are some now, to be honest, that I should probably mention on, I'll put some

275
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,560
of the links to some of them in the show notes.

276
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,440
Some stuff like Outreachy is really, really great.

277
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,680
And they also focus on being very inclusive.

278
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:47,360
So, you know, Outreachy does some amazing work and there are some other mentorship programs

279
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,240
as well.

280
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,440
But unfortunately, some of the mentorship things again, comes with a cost, which is

281
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,240
understandable.

282
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:00,400
But again, if you're not, if you're not in a position to be able to pay, it is just another

283
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,920
roadblock you have to face.

284
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:09,680
And, you know, even though web development specifically, that's what I can talk to mostly,

285
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,200
I've come a heck of a long way since the day was when I started.

286
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:18,800
And a lot of things that used to be super hard are now trivially simple.

287
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,080
It's still not easy.

288
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,040
There's still a lot of questions that that one has.

289
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,680
So, you know, the need for that still exists very much.

290
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,920
No, it definitely does.

291
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:35,200
As for the roadblock of the payment is I have looked into teaching myself in general.

292
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:44,400
So, startup courses for old people or women, especially in my area, don't really know how

293
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,280
computers work.

294
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,320
That was a big thing for me.

295
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,600
A lot of female, older women don't know in the area.

296
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,440
So, I was looking to make something for them to teaching how computers work.

297
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,560
And I completely understand why you charge so much for a course.

298
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,120
It's a lot of hard work.

299
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,520
It's a lot of information gathering and this and that and you need to remember this.

300
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,600
And even once I was ready to start, I still felt like I still have to go through a couple

301
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,880
of things and make sure.

302
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,640
Yeah, I can totally understand why, but not having the funds necessarily available to

303
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,680
you by, let's say $60 for an advanced course you know will help you.

304
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,480
It's quite a hindrance because now I have to go search.

305
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,480
How can I get this information for free?

306
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,080
Yeah.

307
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,920
No, for sure.

308
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,160
No, I completely agree with that.

309
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,560
And the other thing with courses, of course, is that you have to, especially if you're

310
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,920
asking money, is you have to keep it up to date.

311
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:49,120
It's not something you make and then forget about because, you know, the tech industry

312
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,560
evolves and moves quite fast.

313
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:57,680
So, you know, that's the other part is if you want to keep it, if you want it to be

314
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,160
useful, you have to keep it up to date.

315
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:06,480
That is something as well, because I was following books from Microsoft.

316
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,880
I was lucky enough to get access to those books and they fell into that trap.

317
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,560
I would learn and learn and learn and learn at some point and I'll hit a roadblock.

318
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,480
As being, what's this?

319
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,160
It's not working.

320
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,800
What's going on?

321
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,760
And I have to go search for hours and hours and hours just to find out.

322
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,640
This phrase is no longer valid.

323
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,120
Simply change X to Y and it works.

324
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,360
Yeah.

325
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,040
So that is definitely a pitfall I can see some people falling into not keeping everything

326
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,600
up to date.

327
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,640
And it is frustratingly again for us who is new and learning these things because now

328
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,040
where you would know this or know where to look for it, I need to spend two or three

329
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,040
hours trying to find out why it's not working.

330
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,560
What's going on?

331
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,600
What's this error?

332
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:53,840
Yeah.

333
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,680
Yeah, for sure.

334
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:01,200
But teeing off the thing where you said you were looking at creating some courses to teach

335
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,680
people other skills that you already have.

336
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,240
I think in general, that is a good idea and that's something that a lot of people knew

337
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,360
to development.

338
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,160
This doesn't matter what industry it is, are a little bit scared of, but that I would

339
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:21,200
personally encourage is to write about the stuff that you learn because teaching is one

340
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,800
of the best ways of learning.

341
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:30,480
So if you've built something, anything, write about how you made it.

342
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,120
It doesn't necessarily have to tell a story per se about the struggles you had.

343
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:41,040
It can literally just be you writing down how to make a responsive Euro with HTML and

344
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:47,600
CSS, because by doing that, you are thinking through the process of having done that.

345
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,040
Oftentimes you find ways that you can do it even better than what you've already done

346
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,200
it.

347
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,240
So you automatically improve your existing code base.

348
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,840
And at the end of the day, you have a piece of writing that can also be useful for whether

349
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,200
you start a business or whether you're looking for employment.

350
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,880
You have something to point people to, to say, not only did I make this thing, but I

351
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,240
wrote about how I did it.

352
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,880
Because there's not a lot of people that can do both of those things.

353
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,080
A lot of people are really good at writing the software, but they're not so great at

354
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,880
teaching it.

355
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,160
And more often than not, it's not that they don't have the skills.

356
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,080
They just never exercise that skill.

357
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:26,080
So as they exercise their coding skill, they don't exercise writing about their coding.

358
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,240
And so that kind of never develops.

359
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,720
So you have this amazing software engineer, but if he tries to explain something to you,

360
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,760
it's like poop right over your head because they never go back and think about how did

361
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,040
what did I do before I knew how to do this?

362
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,960
How did I get to that point?

363
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:49,120
What was the things that I, what were the things I did wrong and how did I find a better

364
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,240
way and stuff like that.

365
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:56,000
So I think while you're learning, writing about the stuff that you make is incredibly

366
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,480
important.

367
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,760
You just gave me a great idea to maybe branch off of my existing URL to start something

368
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,240
to score RWA's journey.

369
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,400
Just a place we can write, I made a navigation bar today by using this, this, and this.

370
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,520
I hit this roadblock, but I found this information there.

371
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,680
So if someone does read it, they can say, that's my problem.

372
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,680
So I can just go look over there to go fix it.

373
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,160
Because something I hit a hard roadblock with is including JSON into my project.

374
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,880
So everyone is just like, no, just add it, just install it, just do it.

375
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,800
I'm like, yeah, how, how do I do this?

376
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,520
And after like two or three hours, I was like, oh, I just make a text file, change the name

377
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,040
and paste the stuff in and include it into my job and bam, bought your uncle.

378
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,360
Then again, just that little bit of knowledge I couldn't find for about two to three hours

379
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,600
because everyone just explains how to use it, not how to implement it.

380
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:58,720
Yeah.

381
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,280
Gotcha.

382
00:22:59,280 --> 00:22:59,760
Gotcha.

383
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,240
And it's literally because people just don't think that far back anymore.

384
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,080
For them using JSON is just a thing you do.

385
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,600
Like it's just text.

386
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,120
What are you, what are you talking about?

387
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:17,840
But it's like, no, but if you don't know what JSON is and how it fits into the larger

388
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:23,120
framework of building a, let's take, for example, the one tool that I built, developer

389
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:29,360
tool chest, all that is in the end of the day is a website that loads some JSON that

390
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,760
has a specific structure and it loops through them.

391
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,560
And for each entry, it makes little block based on the search filter that you typed

392
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:38,720
in.

393
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:45,600
But if you don't know how JSON fits into that whole thing, it can be like, wait, what

394
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,800
is this JSON now?

395
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,080
Is it a database?

396
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,320
It's like, kind of, not really.

397
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,440
So, you know, it's, it's understanding that no, JSON is just a flat text file that has

398
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,600
certain limitations placed upon it.

399
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,160
And JSON in the end is data.

400
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,040
So this is like the data part of your project.

401
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,640
You describe data inside your JSON document, and then you can consume it as if it's like

402
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,160
a database, kind of, just a very, very loose database.

403
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:21,120
Like, I don't know if you've ever looked up SQLite, but if you, if you haven't, doesn't

404
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,640
matter, just maybe after the podcast, just have a search for SQLite and SQLite is essentially

405
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:34,160
just a flat text file on your hard drive that acts as a database, but you can query the

406
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,920
data as if it's SQL.

407
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,200
That's why SQLite.

408
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,760
And like, it's in everything.

409
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,560
It's in everything, like your mobile phone, your everything.

410
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,280
It's everywhere.

411
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,800
SQLite is like everywhere.

412
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:46,960
Okay.

413
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,520
And I already opened a tab over here for after we're done.

414
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,080
So that's, that's one of those great reads.

415
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,160
And that also reminded me, that's something I see a lot of mentors

416
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,560
fall, I want to say fall short, but I don't know if that's the right word.

417
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,280
That's why I like following Mosch.

418
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,360
He says, use an H1 tag to add a title.

419
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,520
And a lot of people just move on.

420
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,320
But for me personally, I want to know why.

421
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,840
What does it do?

422
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,640
How does it work?

423
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,960
And what he does is he pulls up on the graph and tells you H1 does this.

424
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,760
It adds a title.

425
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,320
It does this.

426
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,200
This is how you use it.

427
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,720
This is how you can use it.

428
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,160
So that is something I've been struggling with as well.

429
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,480
Because I've been following someone doing a text adventure game.

430
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,760
Because that was interesting to me.

431
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,320
This guy would just type, no, use this, this, this, enter.

432
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,840
And go to the next thing.

433
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,120
I'm like, wait, why?

434
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,040
Why did you do this?

435
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,320
How does this work?

436
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,760
You didn't explain to me anything.

437
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,760
You just wrote code on a little pad and moved on.

438
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,480
So he didn't actually teach me anything.

439
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,760
You just showed me what he can do.

440
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:50,960
Yeah.

441
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,520
Yeah.

442
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,020
Yeah.

443
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:59,200
And I guess there's a place for that, but I think more often than not, you find that

444
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,640
a lot on Twitch, like a lot of people on Twitch would stream them working and the idea is

445
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,480
not, you might pick up some stuff by watching, but that's not their intent.

446
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:14,080
Their intent is just like, I'm doing some stuff and maybe I want to be held accountable

447
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,640
and therefore I will stream every day between five and seven and I'll work on this specific

448
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,140
project.

449
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,740
It's more a way of keeping themselves accountable.

450
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,820
And if somebody learned something out of it, then great.

451
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,020
But that's not the intent.

452
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,900
But yeah, that's all good stuff.

453
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:36,340
So I'm wondering, so looking towards the future, say I'm going to, it was two separate

454
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,420
questions, but I think I'm going to throw it into one question.

455
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:39,560
Okay.

456
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:47,220
So you can do one or two things, like you can learn and learn and learn and eventually

457
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:53,700
apply for a job and work for somebody else, or you can do the other thing, which is create

458
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,780
your own opportunity by starting your own business, whether that is building a product

459
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:03,460
or starting an agency where you create websites and design for other people.

460
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:08,660
But I think in both of those areas, it doesn't really matter which one you choose.

461
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,740
This idea of an interview is part of both.

462
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:17,860
The difference being on the one hand, you're interviewing for a specific position at a

463
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:23,140
specific company, the other one you're being interviewed by a client who wants to know

464
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:26,580
that if I give you money, I'll get a website in return.

465
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:30,340
So therefore I need to, you know, I'm just not blindly going to give you money.

466
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,780
I want to speak to you a little bit.

467
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,460
And it's also a kind of an interview.

468
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:39,780
So my question is, which one of the two is of most interest to you, like starting a

469
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,780
business or working for somebody?

470
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:49,380
And based on that, what is the things about these interviews that perhaps scare you a

471
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:49,780
little bit?

472
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,340
Okay.

473
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,420
Personally, I would like to start my own business.

474
00:27:54,420 --> 00:28:01,940
I walked out of high school into my permanent job, working for about three years as a retail

475
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:02,740
salesperson.

476
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:09,460
And after that, I got the opportunity for better hours, more pay doing school photos.

477
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:13,060
So I've been working there for three years now as well.

478
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:17,780
So I've been basically working since I got out of high school and I've reached a point

479
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,420
where I had enough of making someone else rich.

480
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,100
I've got a lot of knowledge.

481
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,180
I've got a lot of experience with a lot of things.

482
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,420
I do feel like I want to start my own thing.

483
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,660
And I want to get away from working for someone else.

484
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,820
I want to start my own business.

485
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:34,420
I want to start doing my own thing, which I already have started.

486
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,020
I'm still looking for clients now.

487
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,300
I've got one client pending.

488
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,740
We still need to do this interview you're talking about.

489
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:48,020
But having about three years worth of sales experience, the interview is a fun part for

490
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:48,260
me.

491
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,260
I look forward to it and it's exciting.

492
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:59,860
I can definitely see the scary bits of it, having to explain to someone why to use you.

493
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:05,860
But what I always found in sales is if you use the term faker to make it, you can sell

494
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,620
a pen to a pen factory.

495
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:13,860
If you're standing up to smile and they ask you, can you do back-end development and do

496
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,380
this whole database thing?

497
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,980
And tell them, yeah, sure.

498
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,340
I do have to do some research.

499
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:23,540
I do need to freshen up on a couple of things, but let's talk, let's see what you can do.

500
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,780
And I'll tell you yes or no, I can or cannot assist you.

501
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:31,140
Then the client's more likely to use you if you're honest about things like that.

502
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,260
Because they don't feel you're trying to scam them out of money.

503
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:38,020
They do feel like, okay, yeah, I do know what I'm doing.

504
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,060
I just need to sharpen up.

505
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,180
So then already feel like, Oh, okay.

506
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,820
So you're not just someone making, looking for a quick buck.

507
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,180
You're actually interested in the work.

508
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,020
Yeah.

509
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,780
Honesty goes a long way in business.

510
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,420
That's for sure.

511
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:55,700
And I mean, I say that knowing full well that the business industry can be a bit of a cut

512
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:01,540
throat industry as well, but I think you have to have morals for yourself and for your business.

513
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:09,700
Like me personally, for me as well, I have very fine lines of the type of clients I'd

514
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,900
be willing to work with and ones I wouldn't be willing to work with.

515
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:17,860
And I think there I shield myself a little bit from this cutthroat, like it's all about

516
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,460
the money kind of thing.

517
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,340
Yeah, I think it's great.

518
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:24,180
I think it's great to be honest and open that, sure, I can do this.

519
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:29,060
This specific part of the project might be a little bit more challenging, but I have

520
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,460
enough experience in how to find answers.

521
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:35,780
That's what I do is I find solutions to problems.

522
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,340
The technology is almost kind of the easy part.

523
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:46,500
Mentally finding a solution is lots of times harder than actually writing the code.

524
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,460
It's understanding what is the problem that the client's facing?

525
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,180
How do I best solve this?

526
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:56,820
And then what technology do I need to employ in order to solve this?

527
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:01,540
Because oftentimes people will come to you with a preconceived idea in their head because

528
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:05,940
they've heard it from a friend, but it might not necessarily be the best solution for them.

529
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,900
There might be something better that's come along since their friend did their thing.

530
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:14,100
Their friend might actually also benefit from your services.

531
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:18,580
Because they might not know that there's a better way to do this now.

532
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:22,980
They could actually save their money or help them grow their business faster.

533
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:28,100
I'm always excited when I hear people wanting to start their own businesses, because

534
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:33,060
if we look at unemployment in the world, the need for jobs is massive.

535
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:40,580
For each of us that starts our own little business and start networking with each other,

536
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,820
we're creating opportunities for ourselves.

537
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,780
But down the line, we're creating opportunities for others.

538
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:50,820
And the nice thing about somebody like yourself, for example, starting a business is you know

539
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:56,260
the pain of having to learn this stuff and having to find a job where people say,

540
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,580
Oh, how much experience do you have?

541
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:02,980
While working experience, not yet, but I've done all these and I, Oh, no, no, no.

542
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,660
We're looking for something five years experience.

543
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:04,980
Sorry.

544
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:10,580
So you'll be more open to listening to somebody and giving them a chance and telling them,

545
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:16,420
you know what, come work, I'll pay you a full salary for a month and let's see how it goes.

546
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:19,380
If by the end of the month, I can see that you could do the job.

547
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,460
Well, and let's just keep going.

548
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:28,820
But if I find that after a month that you can even struggle, but if you're willing to learn

549
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:34,900
and you're willing to do what's necessary to get the work done, I'm happy to, to employ you.

550
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:38,180
I think the more that we can get that, that kind of thing going the better.

551
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:40,340
Yeah.

552
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:43,540
And that sense, that is something I find very difficult.

553
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:48,820
I've been on a lot of platforms like Upwork and so on looking for jobs and I find stuff

554
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,420
and I look at it and I'm like, I can do this.

555
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,260
I can do everything you need.

556
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,420
I have all the requirements.

557
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,460
I've got the technology.

558
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,340
I've got the background.

559
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,620
I've got internet connection.

560
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,420
I've got all of this.

561
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:03,380
The only thing I'm lacking is the three years of experience I must have you're looking for.

562
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:04,900
Yeah.

563
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:10,660
And finding that one person that says, hey, listen, this is your opportunity.

564
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,340
Just try, let's see what you can do.

565
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:13,940
That's all you need.

566
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,460
That's all you need.

567
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,860
That one guy that just says, I'm willing to give you a month's worth of work.

568
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,740
Let's see what you're doing.

569
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,100
How are you doing?

570
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,060
How are you handling this?

571
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:28,660
On a little bit of a side tangent, the interview, just circling back to the interviews,

572
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,060
I do have some advice for people.

573
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,980
I turn it around.

574
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:39,140
If I have a client comes to me, they, I can just find my wording.

575
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,340
I am interviewing them.

576
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,540
I get them to tell me what they need.

577
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,780
I get to tell them what they, get them to tell me what they are looking for,

578
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,820
what they are looking to do.

579
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,380
So, they'll come to me on three pages.

580
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:51,940
I want this done.

581
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,500
I want that done.

582
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,620
I want this there.

583
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:56,020
They'll be like, okay, well, this, I can do for you.

584
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,020
This, I can do for you.

585
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,900
It's very difficult.

586
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,620
It takes long.

587
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,580
So, you are going to be charged more for this because instead of just a quick, quick hours

588
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,580
worth of work, this can take me about three or four hours.

589
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,140
But I can do it another way for you.

590
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:15,540
So, instead of sitting there and wondering like I'm being interviewed, I turn it around.

591
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,540
I ask them, what are you looking for?

592
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,300
What do you want?

593
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,300
What do you want out of this website?

594
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,740
Because obviously I can say whatever I want.

595
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,100
And I might just go off in a site engine for an hour,

596
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,620
just speaking about myself and what I did, not answering any questions.

597
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,740
Where if I tell the client, what's your question?

598
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,260
Then I answer.

599
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,540
What's your next question?

600
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,180
And I answer.

601
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,660
And you ask a question, I say something.

602
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,260
You're like, wait a second.

603
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,220
This is not how it works.

604
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,340
We can't do it this way.

605
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,260
We can do it this way, this way, or this way.

606
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,820
Clients love having options.

607
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:55,380
So it's, you pretty much flipped the interview around and you're interviewing them now.

608
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:59,140
Because at the end of the day, you do need to know from them what you need to do.

609
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:04,900
And having that person just ask you the entire time, what do you want?

610
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,860
What are you looking for?

611
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,540
Yes, I can do this for you.

612
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,980
No, I cannot do this for you.

613
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:11,780
Feels a lot easier than I sell websites.

614
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,780
I make websites, go look over there.

615
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,620
I can make a navigation bar.

616
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:20,260
I can, then you change it all from me, me, me to them.

617
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,740
And you change the focus point around on them.

618
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:27,300
And I feel very special if I can state it like that.

619
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,220
Yeah, no, for sure.

620
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,820
No, that's, that's great advice.

621
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,060
Yeah.

622
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,020
Thanks for sharing that.

623
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,500
This was really cool.

624
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,460
I really enjoyed this.

625
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:40,980
I'm looking forward to seeing where you go and what you do with your business.

626
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:47,540
So before we officially wrap it up, is there any projects you're currently

627
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:51,140
working on that you'd like to tell everybody about, this can be open source,

628
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:54,740
can be side projects, doesn't matter, client projects that you can talk about.

629
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:59,140
Or any like links that you'd like people to, to know about.

630
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:03,620
And of course we'll have them all also in the show notes, but if you want to give

631
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,580
some specific shout outs, then go for it.

632
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,060
Not quite at the moment.

633
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:14,180
I do have a client outstanding that it is going, everything points are going

634
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,500
to use me to create their website.

635
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:21,860
They do work with aluminum and door frames and they install them for

636
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:25,300
different houses all around our area here in Pretoria.

637
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,700
So I will love to share that journey.

638
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:34,020
Like you said, I would love to make a blog for a journey of how I will create that.

639
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:38,660
But as of now, I still need all the information.

640
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,980
So I haven't started yet, but I have started planning.

641
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:46,100
I have started looking at designs and color schemes and stuff like that.

642
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:54,100
The only current project I do have is my own website, which is rwswebdesign.co.za.

643
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,340
It is currently live.

644
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:00,660
I have been communicating with our community, improving some stuff, changing

645
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,380
grammar, updating some of my graphics.

646
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:08,420
And I do keep it up to date because this will be my private business website.

647
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,540
From here on.

648
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:11,540
That's great.

649
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,620
Can you just repeat that URL for us?

650
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:21,860
That's rwswebdesign.co.za.

651
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,340
Okay.

652
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,500
rwswebdesign.co.za.

653
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,460
Go check it out, folks.

654
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:30,900
So other than that, the side projects I don't really have at the moment,

655
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:35,700
I would like to give a shout out to freecodecamp.org.

656
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,380
You actually gave me this site a bit earlier this week, I think.

657
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:43,940
It's an amazing platform so far for me to learn.

658
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,540
They do start from the very basics, which is a bit annoying.

659
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,340
But I got about four or five exercises in,

660
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:53,780
and they've already taught me something new of the basics I didn't know.

661
00:37:55,140 --> 00:38:00,180
So far, it feels like an amazing tutorial, especially for beginners to start at,

662
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,100
because they start simple, easy to understand.

663
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:05,220
They've got documentations and all of that good things.

664
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:06,420
Yeah.

665
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:06,660
Yeah.

666
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,700
The great thing about Free Code Camp is, well, it's free, but

667
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:15,300
beyond that, it's built by a community of contributors.

668
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:19,780
So one, it's kept up to date, constantly being improved.

669
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:25,620
And you yourself, like Riku, that's learning, you can contribute back to that project,

670
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:29,700
even if it's just a small thing where you maybe find the wording of something not

671
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,860
as understandable as you'd like to be.

672
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,060
It's an open source project.

673
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:38,500
You can fork it, open a pull request and propose something that you feel would improve it.

674
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:42,580
So I think it's really great to be involved with projects like that.

675
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,740
And as one of the other ones that I will give a shout out to,

676
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:48,020
because I'm quite involved with them, that is in the same vein.

677
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,220
It's an open source project.

678
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,580
All the content is right there.

679
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,500
It's community written.

680
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:57,380
There are some people paid to work on it, but it's a massive open source project.

681
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:00,580
So I think being involved in these projects is great.

682
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:05,140
And there's a lot of wonderful people behind these projects that would be

683
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,540
happy to receive pull requests.

684
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:11,860
So I can personally send an invitation to everybody listening to you.

685
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:18,900
Both go check out Freecamp and MD and web docs on GitHub and on the web and learn, contribute.

686
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,100
It's all good.

687
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,620
It's all a learning experience.

688
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,540
So yeah, thanks for sharing that.

689
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:30,420
So yeah, no, there's something I would like to go back and actually donate to Freecamp

690
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,580
if, not if, when my business takes off.

691
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,980
When I become a success, I would love to go back and actually donate to them.

692
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,700
And that is something I am very appreciative of them.

693
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,340
They don't cap their learning based on pay gates.

694
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:50,420
You are busy working and it pops up like, hey, listen, would you like to donate?

695
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,220
I just look ashamed like, no, not now.

696
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,940
Maybe once my first site takes off and I've made my first sale,

697
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,860
I'll come back and I'll come donate something.

698
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,580
Oh yeah, I've totally done that.

699
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,620
I've totally done that with a couple of open source things where

700
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:10,420
it's been just like, I wouldn't be where I am without it.

701
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:13,860
And so now that I am where I am, I totally just go and do a monthly,

702
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:20,020
like set up a monthly donation because I want it to be around for the next generation

703
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,380
and I want it to keep improving.

704
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:25,060
So yeah, I think that's great that you're also

705
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:28,100
already preparing yourself for doing that.

706
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:28,820
It's great stuff.

707
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,580
Well, thanks Rico.

708
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,700
It was really great.

709
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:35,140
Thanks for being the first guest on the MyCDA network podcast.

710
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,860
I hope this is going to be one of many, many, many, and we'll do one again once

711
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,380
your business is huge and you've got like hundreds of employees.

712
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,260
No, it's been great.

713
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,300
Thank you for having me.

714
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,740
It's been quite an experience.

715
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:51,620
Always nice to sit and speak to someone about these kinds of things.

716
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:55,140
Yeah, not just sitting in your own mind, just thinking about all of this stuff

717
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,660
and just feeling stuck.

718
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:00,500
So I would actually recommend it for shy people as well.

719
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,380
Get a community, join a community, and just start speaking with people.

720
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:07,860
It really lightens the load if you say it like that.

721
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,420
Yeah, it's been quite a pleasure.

722
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:12,660
Same for me.

723
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:16,820
