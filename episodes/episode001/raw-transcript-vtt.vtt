Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast, a podcast all about early stage web

00:04.880 --> 00:08.320
developers and the mentors and teachers that helped him along the way.

00:09.040 --> 00:12.880
Today, we are going to have a chat with Ricky Smit.

00:12.880 --> 00:16.880
He is some of the people that joined the Mycelium Network very early on and has been

00:16.880 --> 00:18.240
pretty active on the community.

00:18.800 --> 00:22.560
So I thought it only appropriate to have him as one of the first guests.

00:22.560 --> 00:23.280
Hey, Ricky.

00:23.280 --> 00:24.720
Welcome to the podcast.

00:26.160 --> 00:26.880
Thanks for having me.

00:28.960 --> 00:29.760
It's a pleasure.

00:30.720 --> 00:34.960
So I've seen some of these questions to you beforehand, just so you can be a

00:34.960 --> 00:38.640
little bit more prepared, but we'll off the cuff some things here and there.

00:39.280 --> 00:39.920
No pressure.

00:39.920 --> 00:43.680
It's just an informal chat to just learn what works, what doesn't work,

00:43.680 --> 00:47.600
what's the challenges you're facing and how the mentors that I speak

00:47.600 --> 00:49.200
with can potentially help.

00:49.920 --> 00:55.120
So to get us off to a start, tell us a bit about your background.

00:55.600 --> 01:00.320
What did you do up to now and what made you look into getting into software

01:00.320 --> 01:01.840
or web development specifically?

01:04.320 --> 01:08.400
Well, since I was born and raised here in Pretoria, my uncle has been

01:08.400 --> 01:10.160
very heavy into technology.

01:10.960 --> 01:14.560
So ever since I lived, I was little, I remember standing by him, seeing

01:14.560 --> 01:18.160
what he's doing and that intrigued me from a young age.

01:19.520 --> 01:23.520
And then throughout high school, I had the opportunity to take IT and

01:23.600 --> 01:26.720
actually discover the love for coding.

01:26.720 --> 01:30.320
And I had a chance to get all of the fundamentals down.

01:32.320 --> 01:37.760
But as soon as that all ended, I had to basically walk out into a job.

01:37.760 --> 01:43.680
I worked in retail for a hardware shop.

01:46.720 --> 01:49.680
I did what I had to do to survive, but it's not what I wanted to do.

01:49.680 --> 01:53.040
I always had this feeling like I want to do something else.

01:53.680 --> 01:58.160
The first course I had with you, actually, I actually realized how much

01:58.160 --> 02:03.600
I love web development above stuff like app development or server working

02:03.600 --> 02:05.200
or security, stuff like that.

02:05.200 --> 02:10.080
I actually realized I really love working with web, creating pages,

02:11.200 --> 02:12.640
designing new things.

02:12.640 --> 02:14.320
I just fall in love with it.

02:15.680 --> 02:16.160
That's great.

02:18.160 --> 02:20.400
So yeah, I'm looking to study now.

02:20.400 --> 02:23.120
At the end of the day, I would like to be a full stack developer,

02:23.120 --> 02:25.760
being able to do everything and anything that is necessary.

02:27.120 --> 02:28.080
So it's good too.

02:28.080 --> 02:31.680
I think it's good to have that as a goal.

02:31.680 --> 02:38.160
But what I do find is they talk about being T-shaped in terms of your skills.

02:38.160 --> 02:44.960
So you have a broad knowledge base, but then you have something that you focus on.

02:44.960 --> 02:49.760
For myself personally, I do know about backend development and I've done stuff

02:49.760 --> 02:54.080
and I keep doing stuff in that region, like Python a little bit and even

02:54.080 --> 02:58.560
databases, like the old relational kind of stuff, I say old, but people definitely

02:58.560 --> 03:01.520
still use relational databases today.

03:01.520 --> 03:06.320
But I definitely have the T of my T-shape is definitely focused on frontend

03:06.320 --> 03:09.840
development and like, as they say, front of the front.

03:09.840 --> 03:15.280
So I like the design aspects and I like the CSS and making things look good

03:15.280 --> 03:17.760
and work well and performance, accessibility.

03:17.760 --> 03:19.120
Those things are really important to me.

03:19.120 --> 03:23.920
So I think it's good to have that broader perspective of what happens in the

03:23.920 --> 03:30.000
industry, but it's always nice to have something that's more your focus area.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.840
Be a really go deep, as they say that.

03:31.840 --> 03:35.440
So you have this breadth and then you have depth in a certain area.

03:35.440 --> 03:36.160
But that's great.

03:36.160 --> 03:36.400
Yeah.

03:36.400 --> 03:43.920
I know for myself also, I also got into web development from a music background.

03:43.920 --> 03:46.720
For me, the nice thing about web in the early days with Flash and that was still

03:46.800 --> 03:51.360
around was that it had this thing where I could like take the musical aspect and

03:51.360 --> 03:55.600
the design aspect and like take a little bit of programming and like mix them all.

03:55.600 --> 03:59.760
And because we used to make these Flash intros, which are like little movies that

03:59.760 --> 04:03.920
used to play before you'd actually go into the website, really the little movie

04:03.920 --> 04:06.720
with like text and animation and whatnot.

04:06.720 --> 04:08.720
And then it would say, click to enter.

04:08.720 --> 04:10.960
That used to be a huge thing back in the day.

04:10.960 --> 04:15.840
So, you know, I understand like starting something and then being bitten by this

04:15.840 --> 04:18.000
web thing and really digging into it.

04:18.800 --> 04:22.480
So is there something you wanted to expand though?

04:23.520 --> 04:26.720
I must say I am more interested in the front end side of things.

04:27.520 --> 04:31.680
It feels like I would like to know the back end part to make things simpler if

04:31.680 --> 04:32.560
you do get stuck.

04:33.680 --> 04:36.880
But I must definitely say I'm more interested in front end development.

04:36.880 --> 04:39.120
I don't really find PHP interesting.

04:39.920 --> 04:41.280
I hate SQL.

04:41.280 --> 04:42.560
We had to do some in high school.

04:42.560 --> 04:44.320
I absolutely hate it.

04:44.320 --> 04:44.560
Yeah.

04:45.280 --> 04:47.440
Yeah, no, it's, it's a journey.

04:48.560 --> 04:49.440
It is for sure.

04:50.480 --> 04:55.280
So now we know you about your background and how you came to where you are and

04:55.280 --> 04:57.280
what you're looking to do for your future.

04:57.280 --> 05:00.400
Like you mentioned, one of the main things you need to do is learn.

05:00.400 --> 05:07.280
So as you're learning, what, which resources have you like really come to depend on?

05:09.600 --> 05:13.200
I've got three, actually four now.

05:13.840 --> 05:15.920
I really like the input I should get from you.

05:15.920 --> 05:20.400
If we get together, I have a chat about things that's going on and places to find

05:20.400 --> 05:23.600
things to help the development further.

05:24.640 --> 05:26.960
VS code has gotten very essential for me.

05:27.760 --> 05:30.240
It is, I try it sublime text.

05:31.840 --> 05:35.920
It is very bare-boned and feels like amazing if you have a laptop and

05:35.920 --> 05:40.080
javelin round and you have a moment to open up and edit something.

05:40.880 --> 05:45.920
And it's also very, very, it's a lot smaller than VS code.

05:45.920 --> 05:48.400
So it's easier for me to carry around on a flash drive.

05:51.120 --> 05:56.800
So having Git actually is amazing just using GitHub in general because where I am,

05:56.800 --> 05:58.800
I would be able to download my current project.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.600
I'd be able to open it in sublime and work on it.

06:02.800 --> 06:08.800
But when I'm home, I prefer to use GitHub to download my updates and everything and

06:08.800 --> 06:10.880
then work through the VS code.

06:10.880 --> 06:13.360
And funny enough, YouTube is very essential to me.

06:14.960 --> 06:18.960
I struggled to certainly read through a document of pages and pages.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.000
I just can't.

06:21.040 --> 06:24.560
So for me, I like YouTube, someone telling you do this, this, and this, and then they

06:24.560 --> 06:25.200
type it out.

06:25.920 --> 06:30.000
So you can actually pause and go do it yourself and then rinse and rinse until you get the

06:30.000 --> 06:31.040
hang of whatever you're doing.

06:32.160 --> 06:33.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:34.160 --> 06:34.880
Yeah, no, I agree.

06:34.880 --> 06:39.680
There's definitely different modalities that work better for some people.

06:39.680 --> 06:45.920
That is why with the 150 days of HTML thingy that I'm putting together, I have incorporated

06:45.920 --> 06:51.280
video into the pages now so that if you're more of a video person, you can like listen

06:51.280 --> 06:56.240
to me talk through the content, but you have the content just below you as a reference.

06:56.800 --> 07:02.480
I think that that for me is something that I have understood more and more is giving

07:02.480 --> 07:06.400
people different ways to consume the same content because not everybody learns the same

07:06.400 --> 07:07.120
way.

07:07.120 --> 07:12.320
Is there anybody specifically on YouTube that you want to give a shout out to that you find

07:12.320 --> 07:13.520
is particularly good?

07:14.960 --> 07:17.680
Now you're asking me a question half.

07:17.680 --> 07:18.640
I do know his name.

07:18.640 --> 07:20.320
I just want to retrieve it.

07:21.680 --> 07:28.080
If I remember correctly, it's Mosch and he has a lot of coding tutorials online.

07:29.040 --> 07:34.800
His entire teaching style, the way he talks, explains, all of the little graphs and things

07:34.800 --> 07:36.960
he uses is amazing.

07:36.960 --> 07:40.480
I just really like learning this from this guy in particular.

07:42.000 --> 07:42.480
That's great.

07:42.480 --> 07:44.720
I'm trying to just get his name right now.

07:45.280 --> 07:46.880
If I remember correctly, it's Mosch.

07:48.320 --> 07:48.960
Sounds familiar.

07:48.960 --> 07:50.640
I think you've mentioned him to me as well.

07:51.760 --> 07:57.440
One big problem I'm actually running into as a new developer is finding the information

07:57.440 --> 07:57.840
I need.

08:00.880 --> 08:05.600
So more often than not, I find myself asking what's next.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.560
I don't know what to learn from here on out.

08:10.960 --> 08:19.200
Unfortunately, I do rely on free resources at the moment because not currently it's running

08:19.200 --> 08:20.240
from paycheck to paycheck.

08:20.240 --> 08:27.040
So I simply do not have the means to pay for courses quite yet, especially the online stuff

08:27.120 --> 08:28.960
gets really expensive really quickly.

08:29.760 --> 08:31.040
Yes, that's true.

08:32.640 --> 08:33.200
There we go.

08:33.200 --> 08:36.640
I found his name, Mosch Hanadani.

08:37.840 --> 08:38.480
All right, cool.

08:38.480 --> 08:42.960
We should link him up in the, send me the link afterwards and I'll put it in the show

08:42.960 --> 08:48.000
notes and I'll probably reach out to him and see if I can do an interview with him on the

08:48.000 --> 08:48.560
podcast.

08:49.680 --> 08:51.360
Yeah, no, all of those things are very true.

08:51.360 --> 08:56.240
And I think what's gotten nice is something that's starting to get a little more traction

08:56.240 --> 09:00.160
is the idea of purchasing power parity pricing.

09:00.160 --> 09:01.520
That's always a hard one to say.

09:02.800 --> 09:10.080
The idea being that depending on where you live, they will geofence the content, but

09:10.080 --> 09:14.560
you will pay a smaller and lower amount based on where you live.

09:14.560 --> 09:18.320
Somebody that's really great with us is somebody like Ken C. Dodds.

09:18.320 --> 09:22.640
He's got all those courses about React and testing and all that kind of stuff.

09:23.200 --> 09:29.360
And if I, living in South Africa, purchases one of these courses, I get a 60% discount

09:29.360 --> 09:33.200
immediately just because of purchase parity pricing.

09:33.760 --> 09:39.120
So I think that's something that the industry as a whole should consider more widely because

09:39.120 --> 09:43.760
then they can make it, because I understand why people ask money for courses.

09:43.760 --> 09:45.840
It's a heck of a lot of work.

09:45.840 --> 09:48.880
And if you want to do it well, it's especially a lot of work.

09:48.880 --> 09:53.600
And for some people, this is how they make a living.

09:54.160 --> 09:59.840
But it is tough when you come from a third world country or you're just starting out

09:59.840 --> 10:03.920
and you're still finding your feet and you don't have a bunch of money to invest yet.

10:03.920 --> 10:04.880
It is hard.

10:04.880 --> 10:08.800
And there's all kinds of other interesting things developing around that idea as well

10:09.360 --> 10:13.200
with some academies and stuff in the United States exploring a different way of paying

10:14.000 --> 10:14.880
for your courses.

10:15.520 --> 10:16.400
But that is everything.

10:16.400 --> 10:22.800
I think the thing that I get from you is that one big thing that's missing is a roadmap

10:22.800 --> 10:27.680
that you can look at, which points you at specific learning material based on where

10:27.680 --> 10:29.280
you are along your path.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.640
And also which path you're on.

10:32.640 --> 10:34.240
Are you on a backend path?

10:34.240 --> 10:37.520
Are you on a full stack path or are you more on a front end path?

10:37.520 --> 10:42.560
Because you'll have different milestones and different learning material needs there.

10:42.560 --> 10:48.640
So I think that is something that we should look into, see if there are some resources

10:48.640 --> 10:49.280
to help there.

10:49.840 --> 10:50.880
Yeah, no, definitely.

10:50.880 --> 10:56.720
Because being in the front end developer, I've been working, learning, and then I reach

10:56.720 --> 10:58.960
a point and I just look at everything online.

10:59.600 --> 11:00.160
What now?

11:01.120 --> 11:03.680
Do I just invest my time into CSS?

11:04.320 --> 11:07.200
Do I just continue HTML, Java?

11:07.200 --> 11:07.840
What next?

11:07.840 --> 11:08.640
What do I need to do?

11:08.640 --> 11:09.520
What do I need to find?

11:10.320 --> 11:15.520
So I ended up spending two to three hours searching for stuff to learn, running out

11:15.520 --> 11:20.480
of steam, learning for an hour or two, and then continuing with my day rather than having

11:20.480 --> 11:25.600
to go somewhere and spend those hours more, an hour finding this and this and this is

11:25.600 --> 11:26.240
what I need.

11:26.240 --> 11:31.360
And then two to three hours of learning whatever needs to come next.

11:32.400 --> 11:32.880
Yeah.

11:32.880 --> 11:33.600
Yeah.

11:34.480 --> 11:40.240
I think communities such as the Mycelium network can also help there if we, especially if we

11:40.240 --> 11:46.800
can get some more mentors to join our Discord server and then where we're talking about

11:46.800 --> 11:50.720
the idea of having some meetups virtually and in person where possible.

11:51.520 --> 11:57.120
I think that'll help because there you can pose these kinds of questions and, you know,

11:57.120 --> 12:03.120
talk with other people and often more often than not somebody else is being where you

12:03.200 --> 12:07.120
are and they can say, Oh, I actually found this thing and it can kind of help you on

12:07.120 --> 12:07.600
your way.

12:08.240 --> 12:14.320
So I think investing in community and joining in on these communities and being active,

12:14.320 --> 12:18.960
I think is one of the ways that we can start solving this roadmap problem, but we have

12:18.960 --> 12:24.560
to get people from then on learning and people who are teaching in the same place.

12:26.160 --> 12:29.680
A nice mixture of two so you don't have too many mentors and too little.

12:30.640 --> 12:31.520
So yeah, definitely.

12:32.240 --> 12:37.840
And it's, as quite a shy guy, it's almost very difficult for me to enter the community.

12:38.720 --> 12:39.040
Yes.

12:39.040 --> 12:45.520
I don't know why I've always had this thing about online communities, even during my

12:45.520 --> 12:47.200
leisurely hours when I have gaming and stuff.

12:47.840 --> 12:50.160
I would not communicate with both people on the server.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.160
I just find it strange, you can say.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.360
So that was quite difficult for me.

12:55.440 --> 13:00.800
But what I found is you just jump in, find one thing you like, just drop a comment and

13:00.800 --> 13:06.000
see what happens because after that first comment you find it's actually not that

13:06.000 --> 13:07.280
intimidating or scary.

13:07.280 --> 13:08.560
You can just go.

13:09.760 --> 13:11.120
Yeah, that's very true.

13:11.120 --> 13:14.400
And a lot of that comes down to also the people running the community, right?

13:14.960 --> 13:21.680
If you're focused and you start off with good community guidelines and you clearly

13:21.680 --> 13:28.000
enforce them, it helps a lot because there are, you know, bundles out there that just

13:28.000 --> 13:30.560
want to come and, you know, sour the pot.

13:31.120 --> 13:36.560
But as long as there's people that have their finger on the pulse and can quickly

13:36.560 --> 13:41.760
pick that up and make sure that those people are either kicked or reprimanded in a way

13:41.760 --> 13:46.480
that they understand that that kind of behavior is not welcome and their continued

13:46.480 --> 13:52.000
participation is going to hinge very heavily on them changing their attitude.

13:52.000 --> 13:57.200
I think that is important and it's something that unfortunately has been a little rough

13:57.200 --> 13:58.720
on the internet, to put it mildly.

13:59.360 --> 14:01.200
Places got very toxic very quickly.

14:01.200 --> 14:08.720
And for me and you, it might be a little bit easier than for some genders and people of

14:08.720 --> 14:11.120
different races and ethnicities.

14:11.120 --> 14:15.440
For them, it's even harder to really feel comfortable in these groups.

14:16.320 --> 14:20.640
So, you know, big challenges that we have, but as long as we acknowledge them, then at

14:20.640 --> 14:22.160
least we're in the right direction.

14:22.160 --> 14:26.480
I think if you've mentioned a lot of, you've touched on a lot of the stuff from this, the

14:26.480 --> 14:29.920
next question I had in mind, but I'm going to pose it anyway, just in case there's

14:29.920 --> 14:31.040
anything else.

14:31.040 --> 14:34.320
So having talked about all of these resources and stuff.

14:35.120 --> 14:38.400
So clearly there's a bunch of things that don't work, but there are things that work.

14:38.400 --> 14:43.040
But if there's anything else that you feel on that doesn't work to the great side that

14:43.040 --> 14:43.840
you want to highlight.

14:46.640 --> 14:49.440
The work that not works so great is a bit difficult.

14:50.320 --> 14:51.760
Does not work so great.

14:52.720 --> 14:56.320
The only thing I'm personally really stuck on is feeling lost.

14:57.680 --> 14:59.840
You're this drop that falls into an ocean.

14:59.840 --> 15:01.360
I'm just going to told swim.

15:02.080 --> 15:02.960
You don't know where you're going.

15:02.960 --> 15:03.760
You don't know which way.

15:03.760 --> 15:06.960
You don't know if you should swim down or up or what's going on.

15:08.080 --> 15:09.760
That's the only thing that's really missing for me.

15:09.760 --> 15:12.320
But that said, I do have you as a mentor as well.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.280
So I don't feel that lost.

15:15.280 --> 15:19.200
If I get stuck, I can meet up and just say, hey, listen, this is going on.

15:19.200 --> 15:20.800
How can we resolve this?

15:22.320 --> 15:22.560
Yeah.

15:22.560 --> 15:30.320
So clearly that's the important thing to have and to nurture is this whole mental relationship.

15:30.320 --> 15:34.720
So do you think that there's a lot of value there that I think a lot of people miss?

15:36.080 --> 15:36.400
Yeah.

15:36.400 --> 15:37.360
That's so bad to say.

15:37.360 --> 15:42.240
That's definitely something that's missing is finding someone you can ask a question

15:42.240 --> 15:49.200
to, to just ask, how do you add a heading in HTML and not him having a laugh at you

15:49.200 --> 15:51.200
and just saying, oh, okay, let's help you.

15:52.240 --> 15:53.120
This is how we do it.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.160
This is why we do it.

15:55.440 --> 15:59.920
But I did not feel that personally because I did start my journey with you.

16:00.640 --> 16:06.560
So I had that from the get go, but I can really see that being missing in a lot of people's

16:06.560 --> 16:08.160
startup, you can often have same.

16:09.040 --> 16:09.440
Yeah.

16:09.440 --> 16:09.600
Yeah.

16:09.600 --> 16:10.320
No, for sure.

16:10.320 --> 16:11.120
That's true.

16:11.360 --> 16:19.120
I mean, I, I've been there also, and I know that I actually searched widely to try and

16:19.120 --> 16:25.200
find, is there any like networks or mentorship programs or anything like that, that you can

16:25.200 --> 16:25.680
join?

16:25.680 --> 16:31.920
And there are some now, to be honest, that I should probably mention on, I'll put some

16:31.920 --> 16:34.560
of the links to some of them in the show notes.

16:34.560 --> 16:37.440
Some stuff like Outreachy is really, really great.

16:37.440 --> 16:41.680
And they also focus on being very inclusive.

16:41.680 --> 16:47.360
So, you know, Outreachy does some amazing work and there are some other mentorship programs

16:47.360 --> 16:48.240
as well.

16:48.240 --> 16:53.440
But unfortunately, some of the mentorship things again, comes with a cost, which is

16:53.440 --> 16:54.240
understandable.

16:54.240 --> 17:00.400
But again, if you're not, if you're not in a position to be able to pay, it is just another

17:00.400 --> 17:01.920
roadblock you have to face.

17:02.720 --> 17:09.680
And, you know, even though web development specifically, that's what I can talk to mostly,

17:09.680 --> 17:13.200
I've come a heck of a long way since the day was when I started.

17:13.200 --> 17:18.800
And a lot of things that used to be super hard are now trivially simple.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.080
It's still not easy.

17:20.080 --> 17:23.040
There's still a lot of questions that that one has.

17:23.040 --> 17:25.680
So, you know, the need for that still exists very much.

17:26.720 --> 17:27.920
No, it definitely does.

17:27.920 --> 17:35.200
As for the roadblock of the payment is I have looked into teaching myself in general.

17:36.160 --> 17:44.400
So, startup courses for old people or women, especially in my area, don't really know how

17:44.400 --> 17:45.280
computers work.

17:45.280 --> 17:46.320
That was a big thing for me.

17:46.320 --> 17:49.600
A lot of female, older women don't know in the area.

17:49.600 --> 17:53.440
So, I was looking to make something for them to teaching how computers work.

17:53.440 --> 17:58.560
And I completely understand why you charge so much for a course.

17:59.920 --> 18:01.120
It's a lot of hard work.

18:01.120 --> 18:05.520
It's a lot of information gathering and this and that and you need to remember this.

18:06.720 --> 18:11.600
And even once I was ready to start, I still felt like I still have to go through a couple

18:11.600 --> 18:12.880
of things and make sure.

18:14.400 --> 18:20.640
Yeah, I can totally understand why, but not having the funds necessarily available to

18:20.640 --> 18:25.680
you by, let's say $60 for an advanced course you know will help you.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.480
It's quite a hindrance because now I have to go search.

18:28.480 --> 18:30.480
How can I get this information for free?

18:31.760 --> 18:32.080
Yeah.

18:32.880 --> 18:33.920
No, for sure.

18:33.920 --> 18:36.160
No, I completely agree with that.

18:36.160 --> 18:40.560
And the other thing with courses, of course, is that you have to, especially if you're

18:40.560 --> 18:43.920
asking money, is you have to keep it up to date.

18:43.920 --> 18:49.120
It's not something you make and then forget about because, you know, the tech industry

18:50.080 --> 18:52.560
evolves and moves quite fast.

18:52.560 --> 18:57.680
So, you know, that's the other part is if you want to keep it, if you want it to be

18:58.320 --> 19:00.160
useful, you have to keep it up to date.

19:01.920 --> 19:06.480
That is something as well, because I was following books from Microsoft.

19:06.480 --> 19:12.880
I was lucky enough to get access to those books and they fell into that trap.

19:12.880 --> 19:16.560
I would learn and learn and learn and learn at some point and I'll hit a roadblock.

19:17.200 --> 19:18.480
As being, what's this?

19:19.040 --> 19:20.160
It's not working.

19:20.160 --> 19:20.800
What's going on?

19:20.800 --> 19:23.760
And I have to go search for hours and hours and hours just to find out.

19:24.800 --> 19:26.640
This phrase is no longer valid.

19:26.640 --> 19:29.120
Simply change X to Y and it works.

19:31.040 --> 19:31.360
Yeah.

19:32.960 --> 19:37.040
So that is definitely a pitfall I can see some people falling into not keeping everything

19:37.040 --> 19:37.600
up to date.

19:38.960 --> 19:44.640
And it is frustratingly again for us who is new and learning these things because now

19:44.640 --> 19:49.040
where you would know this or know where to look for it, I need to spend two or three

19:49.040 --> 19:51.040
hours trying to find out why it's not working.

19:51.840 --> 19:52.560
What's going on?

19:52.560 --> 19:53.600
What's this error?

19:53.600 --> 19:53.840
Yeah.

19:54.480 --> 19:55.680
Yeah, for sure.

19:55.680 --> 20:01.200
But teeing off the thing where you said you were looking at creating some courses to teach

20:01.200 --> 20:03.680
people other skills that you already have.

20:03.680 --> 20:08.240
I think in general, that is a good idea and that's something that a lot of people knew

20:08.240 --> 20:09.360
to development.

20:09.360 --> 20:14.160
This doesn't matter what industry it is, are a little bit scared of, but that I would

20:14.240 --> 20:21.200
personally encourage is to write about the stuff that you learn because teaching is one

20:21.200 --> 20:22.800
of the best ways of learning.

20:22.800 --> 20:30.480
So if you've built something, anything, write about how you made it.

20:30.480 --> 20:35.120
It doesn't necessarily have to tell a story per se about the struggles you had.

20:35.120 --> 20:41.040
It can literally just be you writing down how to make a responsive Euro with HTML and

20:41.040 --> 20:47.600
CSS, because by doing that, you are thinking through the process of having done that.

20:47.600 --> 20:51.040
Oftentimes you find ways that you can do it even better than what you've already done

20:51.040 --> 20:51.200
it.

20:51.200 --> 20:54.240
So you automatically improve your existing code base.

20:54.880 --> 20:59.840
And at the end of the day, you have a piece of writing that can also be useful for whether

20:59.840 --> 21:03.200
you start a business or whether you're looking for employment.

21:03.200 --> 21:06.880
You have something to point people to, to say, not only did I make this thing, but I

21:06.880 --> 21:08.240
wrote about how I did it.

21:08.240 --> 21:10.880
Because there's not a lot of people that can do both of those things.

21:10.880 --> 21:14.080
A lot of people are really good at writing the software, but they're not so great at

21:14.080 --> 21:14.880
teaching it.

21:14.880 --> 21:18.160
And more often than not, it's not that they don't have the skills.

21:18.160 --> 21:20.080
They just never exercise that skill.

21:20.800 --> 21:26.080
So as they exercise their coding skill, they don't exercise writing about their coding.

21:26.080 --> 21:28.240
And so that kind of never develops.

21:28.240 --> 21:32.720
So you have this amazing software engineer, but if he tries to explain something to you,

21:32.720 --> 21:37.760
it's like poop right over your head because they never go back and think about how did

21:38.320 --> 21:41.040
what did I do before I knew how to do this?

21:41.040 --> 21:42.960
How did I get to that point?

21:43.600 --> 21:49.120
What was the things that I, what were the things I did wrong and how did I find a better

21:49.120 --> 21:50.240
way and stuff like that.

21:50.240 --> 21:56.000
So I think while you're learning, writing about the stuff that you make is incredibly

21:56.000 --> 21:56.480
important.

21:58.240 --> 22:03.760
You just gave me a great idea to maybe branch off of my existing URL to start something

22:03.760 --> 22:06.240
to score RWA's journey.

22:08.480 --> 22:14.400
Just a place we can write, I made a navigation bar today by using this, this, and this.

22:14.400 --> 22:17.520
I hit this roadblock, but I found this information there.

22:18.800 --> 22:21.680
So if someone does read it, they can say, that's my problem.

22:21.680 --> 22:23.680
So I can just go look over there to go fix it.

22:24.960 --> 22:30.160
Because something I hit a hard roadblock with is including JSON into my project.

22:31.040 --> 22:34.880
So everyone is just like, no, just add it, just install it, just do it.

22:34.880 --> 22:36.800
I'm like, yeah, how, how do I do this?

22:38.240 --> 22:43.520
And after like two or three hours, I was like, oh, I just make a text file, change the name

22:43.520 --> 22:47.040
and paste the stuff in and include it into my job and bam, bought your uncle.

22:48.720 --> 22:53.360
Then again, just that little bit of knowledge I couldn't find for about two to three hours

22:53.360 --> 22:57.600
because everyone just explains how to use it, not how to implement it.

22:58.400 --> 22:58.720
Yeah.

22:58.720 --> 22:59.280
Gotcha.

22:59.280 --> 22:59.760
Gotcha.

22:59.760 --> 23:04.240
And it's literally because people just don't think that far back anymore.

23:04.240 --> 23:08.080
For them using JSON is just a thing you do.

23:08.080 --> 23:09.600
Like it's just text.

23:09.600 --> 23:11.120
What are you, what are you talking about?

23:11.120 --> 23:17.840
But it's like, no, but if you don't know what JSON is and how it fits into the larger

23:17.840 --> 23:23.120
framework of building a, let's take, for example, the one tool that I built, developer

23:23.120 --> 23:29.360
tool chest, all that is in the end of the day is a website that loads some JSON that

23:29.360 --> 23:33.760
has a specific structure and it loops through them.

23:33.840 --> 23:38.560
And for each entry, it makes little block based on the search filter that you typed

23:38.560 --> 23:38.720
in.

23:39.280 --> 23:45.600
But if you don't know how JSON fits into that whole thing, it can be like, wait, what

23:45.600 --> 23:46.800
is this JSON now?

23:46.800 --> 23:48.080
Is it a database?

23:48.080 --> 23:50.320
It's like, kind of, not really.

23:50.320 --> 23:55.440
So, you know, it's, it's understanding that no, JSON is just a flat text file that has

23:55.440 --> 23:57.600
certain limitations placed upon it.

23:57.600 --> 24:02.160
And JSON in the end is data.

24:02.720 --> 24:05.040
So this is like the data part of your project.

24:05.600 --> 24:10.640
You describe data inside your JSON document, and then you can consume it as if it's like

24:10.640 --> 24:14.160
a database, kind of, just a very, very loose database.

24:14.160 --> 24:21.120
Like, I don't know if you've ever looked up SQLite, but if you, if you haven't, doesn't

24:21.120 --> 24:26.640
matter, just maybe after the podcast, just have a search for SQLite and SQLite is essentially

24:27.280 --> 24:34.160
just a flat text file on your hard drive that acts as a database, but you can query the

24:34.160 --> 24:35.920
data as if it's SQL.

24:35.920 --> 24:37.200
That's why SQLite.

24:37.200 --> 24:39.760
And like, it's in everything.

24:39.760 --> 24:42.560
It's in everything, like your mobile phone, your everything.

24:42.560 --> 24:43.280
It's everywhere.

24:43.280 --> 24:44.800
SQLite is like everywhere.

24:46.640 --> 24:46.960
Okay.

24:46.960 --> 24:49.520
And I already opened a tab over here for after we're done.

24:49.520 --> 24:52.080
So that's, that's one of those great reads.

24:52.720 --> 24:56.160
And that also reminded me, that's something I see a lot of mentors

24:56.960 --> 25:00.560
fall, I want to say fall short, but I don't know if that's the right word.

25:01.360 --> 25:03.280
That's why I like following Mosch.

25:04.160 --> 25:07.360
He says, use an H1 tag to add a title.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.520
And a lot of people just move on.

25:10.720 --> 25:12.320
But for me personally, I want to know why.

25:12.960 --> 25:13.840
What does it do?

25:13.840 --> 25:14.640
How does it work?

25:15.280 --> 25:18.960
And what he does is he pulls up on the graph and tells you H1 does this.

25:18.960 --> 25:19.760
It adds a title.

25:19.760 --> 25:20.320
It does this.

25:20.320 --> 25:21.200
This is how you use it.

25:21.280 --> 25:22.720
This is how you can use it.

25:23.920 --> 25:26.160
So that is something I've been struggling with as well.

25:26.880 --> 25:30.480
Because I've been following someone doing a text adventure game.

25:30.480 --> 25:31.760
Because that was interesting to me.

25:33.280 --> 25:36.320
This guy would just type, no, use this, this, this, enter.

25:36.880 --> 25:37.840
And go to the next thing.

25:37.840 --> 25:39.120
I'm like, wait, why?

25:40.080 --> 25:41.040
Why did you do this?

25:41.040 --> 25:42.320
How does this work?

25:42.320 --> 25:43.760
You didn't explain to me anything.

25:43.760 --> 25:45.760
You just wrote code on a little pad and moved on.

25:46.720 --> 25:48.480
So he didn't actually teach me anything.

25:48.480 --> 25:49.760
You just showed me what he can do.

25:50.560 --> 25:50.960
Yeah.

25:51.040 --> 25:51.520
Yeah.

25:51.520 --> 25:52.020
Yeah.

25:52.880 --> 25:59.200
And I guess there's a place for that, but I think more often than not, you find that

25:59.200 --> 26:04.640
a lot on Twitch, like a lot of people on Twitch would stream them working and the idea is

26:04.640 --> 26:08.480
not, you might pick up some stuff by watching, but that's not their intent.

26:08.480 --> 26:14.080
Their intent is just like, I'm doing some stuff and maybe I want to be held accountable

26:14.080 --> 26:18.640
and therefore I will stream every day between five and seven and I'll work on this specific

26:18.640 --> 26:19.140
project.

26:19.700 --> 26:22.740
It's more a way of keeping themselves accountable.

26:22.740 --> 26:24.820
And if somebody learned something out of it, then great.

26:24.820 --> 26:26.020
But that's not the intent.

26:26.820 --> 26:28.900
But yeah, that's all good stuff.

26:28.900 --> 26:36.340
So I'm wondering, so looking towards the future, say I'm going to, it was two separate

26:36.340 --> 26:38.420
questions, but I think I'm going to throw it into one question.

26:39.060 --> 26:39.560
Okay.

26:40.500 --> 26:47.220
So you can do one or two things, like you can learn and learn and learn and eventually

26:47.220 --> 26:53.700
apply for a job and work for somebody else, or you can do the other thing, which is create

26:53.700 --> 26:57.780
your own opportunity by starting your own business, whether that is building a product

26:57.780 --> 27:03.460
or starting an agency where you create websites and design for other people.

27:04.020 --> 27:08.660
But I think in both of those areas, it doesn't really matter which one you choose.

27:09.380 --> 27:12.740
This idea of an interview is part of both.

27:13.540 --> 27:17.860
The difference being on the one hand, you're interviewing for a specific position at a

27:17.860 --> 27:23.140
specific company, the other one you're being interviewed by a client who wants to know

27:23.140 --> 27:26.580
that if I give you money, I'll get a website in return.

27:26.580 --> 27:30.340
So therefore I need to, you know, I'm just not blindly going to give you money.

27:30.340 --> 27:31.780
I want to speak to you a little bit.

27:31.780 --> 27:33.460
And it's also a kind of an interview.

27:34.020 --> 27:39.780
So my question is, which one of the two is of most interest to you, like starting a

27:39.780 --> 27:41.780
business or working for somebody?

27:42.500 --> 27:49.380
And based on that, what is the things about these interviews that perhaps scare you a

27:49.380 --> 27:49.780
little bit?

27:51.780 --> 27:52.340
Okay.

27:52.340 --> 27:54.420
Personally, I would like to start my own business.

27:54.420 --> 28:01.940
I walked out of high school into my permanent job, working for about three years as a retail

28:01.940 --> 28:02.740
salesperson.

28:04.180 --> 28:09.460
And after that, I got the opportunity for better hours, more pay doing school photos.

28:10.180 --> 28:13.060
So I've been working there for three years now as well.

28:13.060 --> 28:17.780
So I've been basically working since I got out of high school and I've reached a point

28:17.780 --> 28:20.420
where I had enough of making someone else rich.

28:21.060 --> 28:22.100
I've got a lot of knowledge.

28:22.100 --> 28:24.180
I've got a lot of experience with a lot of things.

28:24.180 --> 28:26.420
I do feel like I want to start my own thing.

28:26.420 --> 28:28.660
And I want to get away from working for someone else.

28:29.700 --> 28:30.820
I want to start my own business.

28:30.820 --> 28:34.420
I want to start doing my own thing, which I already have started.

28:34.420 --> 28:36.020
I'm still looking for clients now.

28:36.020 --> 28:37.300
I've got one client pending.

28:37.860 --> 28:40.740
We still need to do this interview you're talking about.

28:43.540 --> 28:48.020
But having about three years worth of sales experience, the interview is a fun part for

28:48.020 --> 28:48.260
me.

28:48.260 --> 28:50.260
I look forward to it and it's exciting.

28:54.340 --> 28:59.860
I can definitely see the scary bits of it, having to explain to someone why to use you.

29:00.740 --> 29:05.860
But what I always found in sales is if you use the term faker to make it, you can sell

29:05.860 --> 29:07.620
a pen to a pen factory.

29:08.740 --> 29:13.860
If you're standing up to smile and they ask you, can you do back-end development and do

29:13.860 --> 29:15.380
this whole database thing?

29:15.380 --> 29:16.980
And tell them, yeah, sure.

29:16.980 --> 29:18.340
I do have to do some research.

29:18.340 --> 29:23.540
I do need to freshen up on a couple of things, but let's talk, let's see what you can do.

29:23.540 --> 29:25.780
And I'll tell you yes or no, I can or cannot assist you.

29:26.900 --> 29:31.140
Then the client's more likely to use you if you're honest about things like that.

29:31.940 --> 29:34.260
Because they don't feel you're trying to scam them out of money.

29:34.260 --> 29:38.020
They do feel like, okay, yeah, I do know what I'm doing.

29:38.020 --> 29:39.060
I just need to sharpen up.

29:39.940 --> 29:42.180
So then already feel like, Oh, okay.

29:42.180 --> 29:44.820
So you're not just someone making, looking for a quick buck.

29:44.820 --> 29:46.180
You're actually interested in the work.

29:47.700 --> 29:48.020
Yeah.

29:48.020 --> 29:49.780
Honesty goes a long way in business.

29:49.780 --> 29:50.420
That's for sure.

29:50.420 --> 29:55.700
And I mean, I say that knowing full well that the business industry can be a bit of a cut

29:55.700 --> 30:01.540
throat industry as well, but I think you have to have morals for yourself and for your business.

30:02.180 --> 30:09.700
Like me personally, for me as well, I have very fine lines of the type of clients I'd

30:09.700 --> 30:12.900
be willing to work with and ones I wouldn't be willing to work with.

30:12.900 --> 30:17.860
And I think there I shield myself a little bit from this cutthroat, like it's all about

30:17.860 --> 30:19.460
the money kind of thing.

30:19.460 --> 30:20.340
Yeah, I think it's great.

30:20.340 --> 30:24.180
I think it's great to be honest and open that, sure, I can do this.

30:24.180 --> 30:29.060
This specific part of the project might be a little bit more challenging, but I have

30:29.060 --> 30:31.460
enough experience in how to find answers.

30:31.460 --> 30:35.780
That's what I do is I find solutions to problems.

30:35.780 --> 30:38.340
The technology is almost kind of the easy part.

30:40.340 --> 30:46.500
Mentally finding a solution is lots of times harder than actually writing the code.

30:46.500 --> 30:49.460
It's understanding what is the problem that the client's facing?

30:50.260 --> 30:52.180
How do I best solve this?

30:52.180 --> 30:56.820
And then what technology do I need to employ in order to solve this?

30:56.820 --> 31:01.540
Because oftentimes people will come to you with a preconceived idea in their head because

31:01.540 --> 31:05.940
they've heard it from a friend, but it might not necessarily be the best solution for them.

31:06.500 --> 31:10.900
There might be something better that's come along since their friend did their thing.

31:10.900 --> 31:14.100
Their friend might actually also benefit from your services.

31:15.140 --> 31:18.580
Because they might not know that there's a better way to do this now.

31:18.580 --> 31:22.980
They could actually save their money or help them grow their business faster.

31:23.700 --> 31:28.100
I'm always excited when I hear people wanting to start their own businesses, because

31:28.660 --> 31:33.060
if we look at unemployment in the world, the need for jobs is massive.

31:35.940 --> 31:40.580
For each of us that starts our own little business and start networking with each other,

31:40.580 --> 31:42.820
we're creating opportunities for ourselves.

31:42.820 --> 31:45.780
But down the line, we're creating opportunities for others.

31:45.780 --> 31:50.820
And the nice thing about somebody like yourself, for example, starting a business is you know

31:50.820 --> 31:56.260
the pain of having to learn this stuff and having to find a job where people say,

31:56.260 --> 31:58.580
Oh, how much experience do you have?

31:58.580 --> 32:02.980
While working experience, not yet, but I've done all these and I, Oh, no, no, no.

32:02.980 --> 32:04.660
We're looking for something five years experience.

32:04.660 --> 32:04.980
Sorry.

32:05.620 --> 32:10.580
So you'll be more open to listening to somebody and giving them a chance and telling them,

32:10.580 --> 32:16.420
you know what, come work, I'll pay you a full salary for a month and let's see how it goes.

32:16.420 --> 32:19.380
If by the end of the month, I can see that you could do the job.

32:21.300 --> 32:23.460
Well, and let's just keep going.

32:23.460 --> 32:28.820
But if I find that after a month that you can even struggle, but if you're willing to learn

32:28.820 --> 32:34.900
and you're willing to do what's necessary to get the work done, I'm happy to, to employ you.

32:34.900 --> 32:38.180
I think the more that we can get that, that kind of thing going the better.

32:40.020 --> 32:40.340
Yeah.

32:40.340 --> 32:43.540
And that sense, that is something I find very difficult.

32:43.540 --> 32:48.820
I've been on a lot of platforms like Upwork and so on looking for jobs and I find stuff

32:48.820 --> 32:50.420
and I look at it and I'm like, I can do this.

32:50.820 --> 32:52.260
I can do everything you need.

32:53.140 --> 32:54.420
I have all the requirements.

32:54.420 --> 32:55.460
I've got the technology.

32:55.460 --> 32:56.340
I've got the background.

32:56.340 --> 32:57.620
I've got internet connection.

32:57.620 --> 32:58.420
I've got all of this.

32:59.300 --> 33:03.380
The only thing I'm lacking is the three years of experience I must have you're looking for.

33:04.580 --> 33:04.900
Yeah.

33:04.900 --> 33:10.660
And finding that one person that says, hey, listen, this is your opportunity.

33:10.660 --> 33:12.340
Just try, let's see what you can do.

33:13.140 --> 33:13.940
That's all you need.

33:14.660 --> 33:15.460
That's all you need.

33:15.460 --> 33:19.860
That one guy that just says, I'm willing to give you a month's worth of work.

33:19.860 --> 33:20.740
Let's see what you're doing.

33:21.380 --> 33:22.100
How are you doing?

33:22.100 --> 33:23.060
How are you handling this?

33:24.660 --> 33:28.660
On a little bit of a side tangent, the interview, just circling back to the interviews,

33:29.700 --> 33:31.060
I do have some advice for people.

33:31.860 --> 33:32.980
I turn it around.

33:34.180 --> 33:39.140
If I have a client comes to me, they, I can just find my wording.

33:39.140 --> 33:40.340
I am interviewing them.

33:41.620 --> 33:43.540
I get them to tell me what they need.

33:44.340 --> 33:47.780
I get to tell them what they, get them to tell me what they are looking for,

33:47.780 --> 33:48.820
what they are looking to do.

33:49.620 --> 33:51.380
So, they'll come to me on three pages.

33:51.380 --> 33:51.940
I want this done.

33:51.940 --> 33:52.500
I want that done.

33:52.500 --> 33:53.620
I want this there.

33:53.620 --> 33:56.020
They'll be like, okay, well, this, I can do for you.

33:56.660 --> 33:58.020
This, I can do for you.

33:58.020 --> 33:58.900
It's very difficult.

33:58.900 --> 33:59.620
It takes long.

34:00.500 --> 34:04.580
So, you are going to be charged more for this because instead of just a quick, quick hours

34:04.580 --> 34:06.580
worth of work, this can take me about three or four hours.

34:07.300 --> 34:09.140
But I can do it another way for you.

34:10.580 --> 34:15.540
So, instead of sitting there and wondering like I'm being interviewed, I turn it around.

34:15.540 --> 34:17.540
I ask them, what are you looking for?

34:18.500 --> 34:19.300
What do you want?

34:19.300 --> 34:21.300
What do you want out of this website?

34:22.420 --> 34:24.740
Because obviously I can say whatever I want.

34:25.700 --> 34:28.100
And I might just go off in a site engine for an hour,

34:28.100 --> 34:31.620
just speaking about myself and what I did, not answering any questions.

34:32.660 --> 34:34.740
Where if I tell the client, what's your question?

34:35.380 --> 34:36.260
Then I answer.

34:36.260 --> 34:37.540
What's your next question?

34:37.540 --> 34:38.180
And I answer.

34:39.140 --> 34:40.660
And you ask a question, I say something.

34:40.660 --> 34:42.260
You're like, wait a second.

34:42.260 --> 34:43.220
This is not how it works.

34:43.220 --> 34:44.340
We can't do it this way.

34:44.340 --> 34:46.260
We can do it this way, this way, or this way.

34:47.220 --> 34:48.820
Clients love having options.

34:50.180 --> 34:55.380
So it's, you pretty much flipped the interview around and you're interviewing them now.

34:55.940 --> 34:59.140
Because at the end of the day, you do need to know from them what you need to do.

35:00.980 --> 35:04.900
And having that person just ask you the entire time, what do you want?

35:04.900 --> 35:05.860
What are you looking for?

35:06.500 --> 35:07.540
Yes, I can do this for you.

35:07.540 --> 35:08.980
No, I cannot do this for you.

35:08.980 --> 35:11.780
Feels a lot easier than I sell websites.

35:11.780 --> 35:13.780
I make websites, go look over there.

35:13.780 --> 35:15.620
I can make a navigation bar.

35:15.940 --> 35:20.260
I can, then you change it all from me, me, me to them.

35:20.260 --> 35:22.740
And you change the focus point around on them.

35:23.540 --> 35:27.300
And I feel very special if I can state it like that.

35:28.260 --> 35:29.220
Yeah, no, for sure.

35:29.220 --> 35:30.820
No, that's, that's great advice.

35:30.820 --> 35:31.060
Yeah.

35:31.060 --> 35:32.020
Thanks for sharing that.

35:33.460 --> 35:34.500
This was really cool.

35:34.500 --> 35:35.460
I really enjoyed this.

35:36.100 --> 35:40.980
I'm looking forward to seeing where you go and what you do with your business.

35:41.860 --> 35:47.540
So before we officially wrap it up, is there any projects you're currently

35:47.540 --> 35:51.140
working on that you'd like to tell everybody about, this can be open source,

35:51.140 --> 35:54.740
can be side projects, doesn't matter, client projects that you can talk about.

35:55.300 --> 35:59.140
Or any like links that you'd like people to, to know about.

35:59.140 --> 36:03.620
And of course we'll have them all also in the show notes, but if you want to give

36:03.620 --> 36:06.580
some specific shout outs, then go for it.

36:07.780 --> 36:09.060
Not quite at the moment.

36:09.060 --> 36:14.180
I do have a client outstanding that it is going, everything points are going

36:14.180 --> 36:16.500
to use me to create their website.

36:16.500 --> 36:21.860
They do work with aluminum and door frames and they install them for

36:21.860 --> 36:25.300
different houses all around our area here in Pretoria.

36:26.500 --> 36:29.700
So I will love to share that journey.

36:29.700 --> 36:34.020
Like you said, I would love to make a blog for a journey of how I will create that.

36:35.060 --> 36:38.660
But as of now, I still need all the information.

36:38.660 --> 36:40.980
So I haven't started yet, but I have started planning.

36:40.980 --> 36:46.100
I have started looking at designs and color schemes and stuff like that.

36:47.060 --> 36:54.100
The only current project I do have is my own website, which is rwswebdesign.co.za.

36:55.220 --> 36:56.340
It is currently live.

36:56.340 --> 37:00.660
I have been communicating with our community, improving some stuff, changing

37:00.660 --> 37:03.380
grammar, updating some of my graphics.

37:03.380 --> 37:08.420
And I do keep it up to date because this will be my private business website.

37:08.820 --> 37:09.540
From here on.

37:11.060 --> 37:11.540
That's great.

37:12.820 --> 37:15.620
Can you just repeat that URL for us?

37:16.180 --> 37:21.860
That's rwswebdesign.co.za.

37:21.860 --> 37:22.340
Okay.

37:22.340 --> 37:24.500
rwswebdesign.co.za.

37:24.500 --> 37:25.460
Go check it out, folks.

37:26.900 --> 37:30.900
So other than that, the side projects I don't really have at the moment,

37:31.540 --> 37:35.700
I would like to give a shout out to freecodecamp.org.

37:35.700 --> 37:39.380
You actually gave me this site a bit earlier this week, I think.

37:41.060 --> 37:43.940
It's an amazing platform so far for me to learn.

37:44.500 --> 37:47.540
They do start from the very basics, which is a bit annoying.

37:48.260 --> 37:50.340
But I got about four or five exercises in,

37:50.340 --> 37:53.780
and they've already taught me something new of the basics I didn't know.

37:55.140 --> 38:00.180
So far, it feels like an amazing tutorial, especially for beginners to start at,

38:00.180 --> 38:02.100
because they start simple, easy to understand.

38:02.740 --> 38:05.220
They've got documentations and all of that good things.

38:06.020 --> 38:06.420
Yeah.

38:06.420 --> 38:06.660
Yeah.

38:06.660 --> 38:09.700
The great thing about Free Code Camp is, well, it's free, but

38:11.300 --> 38:15.300
beyond that, it's built by a community of contributors.

38:15.300 --> 38:19.780
So one, it's kept up to date, constantly being improved.

38:20.340 --> 38:25.620
And you yourself, like Riku, that's learning, you can contribute back to that project,

38:25.620 --> 38:29.700
even if it's just a small thing where you maybe find the wording of something not

38:29.700 --> 38:31.860
as understandable as you'd like to be.

38:31.860 --> 38:33.060
It's an open source project.

38:33.060 --> 38:38.500
You can fork it, open a pull request and propose something that you feel would improve it.

38:38.500 --> 38:42.580
So I think it's really great to be involved with projects like that.

38:42.580 --> 38:44.740
And as one of the other ones that I will give a shout out to,

38:44.740 --> 38:48.020
because I'm quite involved with them, that is in the same vein.

38:48.020 --> 38:49.220
It's an open source project.

38:49.220 --> 38:50.580
All the content is right there.

38:50.580 --> 38:52.500
It's community written.

38:52.500 --> 38:57.380
There are some people paid to work on it, but it's a massive open source project.

38:57.380 --> 39:00.580
So I think being involved in these projects is great.

39:01.540 --> 39:05.140
And there's a lot of wonderful people behind these projects that would be

39:05.140 --> 39:07.540
happy to receive pull requests.

39:07.540 --> 39:11.860
So I can personally send an invitation to everybody listening to you.

39:12.500 --> 39:18.900
Both go check out Freecamp and MD and web docs on GitHub and on the web and learn, contribute.

39:19.460 --> 39:20.100
It's all good.

39:20.100 --> 39:21.620
It's all a learning experience.

39:21.620 --> 39:23.540
So yeah, thanks for sharing that.

39:25.540 --> 39:30.420
So yeah, no, there's something I would like to go back and actually donate to Freecamp

39:31.380 --> 39:34.580
if, not if, when my business takes off.

39:35.540 --> 39:38.980
When I become a success, I would love to go back and actually donate to them.

39:38.980 --> 39:41.700
And that is something I am very appreciative of them.

39:42.500 --> 39:46.340
They don't cap their learning based on pay gates.

39:46.980 --> 39:50.420
You are busy working and it pops up like, hey, listen, would you like to donate?

39:51.300 --> 39:53.220
I just look ashamed like, no, not now.

39:55.220 --> 39:57.940
Maybe once my first site takes off and I've made my first sale,

39:57.940 --> 39:59.860
I'll come back and I'll come donate something.

40:00.740 --> 40:02.580
Oh yeah, I've totally done that.

40:03.220 --> 40:05.620
I've totally done that with a couple of open source things where

40:06.260 --> 40:10.420
it's been just like, I wouldn't be where I am without it.

40:10.420 --> 40:13.860
And so now that I am where I am, I totally just go and do a monthly,

40:14.500 --> 40:20.020
like set up a monthly donation because I want it to be around for the next generation

40:20.020 --> 40:21.380
and I want it to keep improving.

40:21.940 --> 40:25.060
So yeah, I think that's great that you're also

40:25.060 --> 40:28.100
already preparing yourself for doing that.

40:28.100 --> 40:28.820
It's great stuff.

40:29.460 --> 40:30.580
Well, thanks Rico.

40:30.580 --> 40:31.700
It was really great.

40:31.700 --> 40:35.140
Thanks for being the first guest on the MyCDA network podcast.

40:35.700 --> 40:39.860
I hope this is going to be one of many, many, many, and we'll do one again once

40:40.500 --> 40:43.380
your business is huge and you've got like hundreds of employees.

40:45.300 --> 40:46.260
No, it's been great.

40:46.260 --> 40:47.300
Thank you for having me.

40:47.300 --> 40:48.740
It's been quite an experience.

40:48.740 --> 40:51.620
Always nice to sit and speak to someone about these kinds of things.

40:52.180 --> 40:55.140
Yeah, not just sitting in your own mind, just thinking about all of this stuff

40:55.140 --> 40:56.660
and just feeling stuck.

40:57.380 --> 41:00.500
So I would actually recommend it for shy people as well.

41:00.500 --> 41:03.380
Get a community, join a community, and just start speaking with people.

41:04.340 --> 41:07.860
It really lightens the load if you say it like that.

41:08.820 --> 41:10.420
Yeah, it's been quite a pleasure.

41:12.100 --> 41:12.660
Same for me.

41:13.300 --> 41:16.820
