00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
Welcome to the Mycelium Network podcast.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,680
The podcast all about early stage record developers and the mentors and teachers that helped

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,680
him along the way.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,760
Today, we are going to have a chat with Rico Smit.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,040
Here are some of the people that joined my Mycelium Network very early on and has been

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,120
pretty active on the community.

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,560
So I thought it only appropriate to have him as one of the first guests.

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,120
Hey, Riku, welcome to the podcast.

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,120
Thanks for having me.

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,120
It's a pleasure.

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:39,120
So I've seen some of these questions to you before I just say you can be a little bit more prepared, but we'll off the cuff some things here and there.

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:49,120
No pressure is just informal chat to just learn what works what doesn't work. What's the challenges you're facing and how the mentors that I speak with can potentially help.

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:57,680
help. So to get us off to a start, tell us a bit about your background. What did you do up to now

14
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,080
and what made you look into getting into software or web development specifically?

15
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:07,680
Well, since I was born, Razia in Bratoria,

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,600
Michael has been very heavy into technology. So ever since I lived, I was a little, I remember

17
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,320
standing by him, seeing what he's doing, and letting me treat me from a young age.

18
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:25,280
And then throughout high school, I had the opportunity to take acting and actually discover the

19
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:34,480
love for coding and I had a chance to get all of the fundamentals down. But as soon as that all

20
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:43,520
ended, I had to basically walk out into a job. I worked in retail for a hardware

21
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:51,920
It's, I did what I had to survive, but it's not what I wanted to always had this feeling

22
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,020
like I want to do something else.

23
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:59,760
The first course I had with you, actually, I actually realized how much I love web development

24
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:05,440
above stuff like app development or server working or security stuff like that.

25
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:12,880
I actually realized I really love working with web, creating pages, designing new things.

26
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,720
I just fall in love with it.

27
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,560
That's great.

28
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,440
So yeah, I'm looking to study now.

29
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,360
At the end of the day, I would like to be a full stack developer,

30
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,000
being able to do everything in anything Yari is necessary.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,320
So it's good to...

32
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,920
I think it's good to have that as a goal,

33
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,200
but what I do find is that they talk about being t-shaped

34
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,320
in terms of your skills.

35
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,600
So you have a broad knowledge base,

36
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,000
But then you have something that you like focus it.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,040
Like for myself personally, I do know about back in development

38
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,160
and I've done stuff and I keep doing stuff

39
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,680
in that region like Python a little bit

40
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,120
and even databases told like the old relational kind of stuff.

41
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,800
I say old but people's definitely

42
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,720
still use traditional databases today.

43
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,760
But I definitely have the T of my T shape

44
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,200
is definitely focused on friendly development

45
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,040
and like as they say front of the front.

46
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:17,960
So I like the design aspects and I like the CSS and making things look good and work well and performance accessibility.

47
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,120
Those things already important to me.

48
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:30,240
So I think it's good to have that broader perspective of what happens in the industry, but it's always nice to have something that that's more your focus area.

49
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,040
Be really go deep as they say that.

50
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,280
So you have this breadth and then you have depth in a certain area.

51
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,360
But that's great.

52
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:43,920
Yeah, I know for myself also I also got into web development from a music background.

53
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,240
And for me, the nice thing about web in the early days when Flash and that was still around

54
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:52,720
was that it had this thing where I could like take the musical aspect and the design aspect

55
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,880
and like take a little bit of programming and like mix them all in because we used to

56
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,240
make these flash intros which are like little movies that used to play before you'd actually

57
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:07,080
going to the website. We've got a little movie with like text and animation and whatnot and then

58
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,760
it would say click to enter. It had used to be a huge thing back in the day. So, you know, I

59
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:18,120
understand like starting something and then being bitten by this web thing and really digging into it.

60
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,600
So, is there something you wanted to expand though?

61
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,920
I must say I'm more interested in the front-end side of things. It feels like I would like to know

62
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:35,240
the back end port to make things simpler if you do get stuck. But I must definitely say

63
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,520
more interested in front end development. I'm done to really find PHP interesting. I hate

64
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:47,120
this y'all. We had to do some in high school. I absolutely hate it. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's

65
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:54,280
a journey. It is. Push up. So now we know you about your background and how you came

66
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,320
to where you are and what you're looking to do for your future. Like you mentioned, one

67
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,560
of the main things you need to do is learn.

68
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,560
So as you're learning, which resources of you

69
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,680
like really come to the PENDLE?

70
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,120
- I've got three, actually four now.

71
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,240
I really like the input I should get from you.

72
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,080
If we get together, I have a chat about things

73
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,120
that's going on in places to find things

74
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,920
to help the development further.

75
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,960
VSCode has gotten very essential for me.

76
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,720
It is, I try it, sublime text.

77
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,360
It is a very very bone and feels like amazing

78
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,680
if you have a laptop and juggling around.

79
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,440
And you have a moment of could open up and edit something.

80
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,200
It's also very very, it's a lot smaller than VS Code.

81
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,680
So it's easy for me to carry around on a flash drive.

82
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,320
- Like that, yeah.

83
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,640
- So having Git actually is amazing,

84
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,400
just using GitHub in general,

85
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,200
because where I am I would be able to download my current project.

86
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,960
I'd be able to open it and sublime and work on it.

87
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:07,640
But when I'm home, I prefer to use get up to download my updates and everything

88
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,800
and then work through the VS code.

89
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,600
And funny enough, YouTube is very essential to me.

90
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:20,300
I struggle to certain read through a document of pages and pages I just can't.

91
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,600
So for me, I like YouTube.

92
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,600
Someone telling you do this, this and this and then they type it out.

93
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,560
So you can actually pause and go into it yourself and then rinse it and

94
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,240
so you get the hang of whatever you're doing.

95
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,120
Yeah, yeah.

96
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,120
Yeah, now I agree.

97
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,680
There's definitely different modalities that work better for some people.

98
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,800
That is why with the 150 days of HTML thingy that I'm putting together,

99
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,880
I have incorporated video into the pages now so that if you're more of a video

100
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:54,360
person, you can like listen to me talk through the content, but you have the

101
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:00,560
content just below you as a reference. I think that that for me is something that I have understood

102
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,120
more and more is giving people different ways to consume the same content because not everybody learns

103
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,880
the same way. Is there anybody specifically on YouTube that you want to like give a shout out to

104
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:18,840
that you find is particularly good? Now you're asking me a question half. I do know his name,

105
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:27,240
much good, so you want to tree that. If I remember correctly, it's mush and he has a lot of coding

106
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:34,280
tutorials online. His entire teaching style, the way he talks, explains all of the little

107
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:40,040
graphs and things he uses is amazing. I just really like learning this from this guy,

108
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:47,000
particular. Let's try to just get his name right now. If I remember correctly, it's mush.

109
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,920
Time somebody I think you've mentioned in to me as well.

110
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:57,960
The one big problem actually running into as a new developers finding the information I meet.

111
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:07,080
Yeah, yeah. So more often than not, I'd find myself asking what's next. I don't know what to learn

112
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,800
from here on out.

113
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:19,560
Unfortunately, I do rely on free resources at the moment because not currently is running from

114
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:25,800
paycheck to paycheck. So I simply do not have the means to pay for courses quite yet, especially

115
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,160
the online stuff gets really expensive really quickly. Yes, that's true.

116
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,680
There we go. I found his name, Marsh Hanna Dany.

117
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,960
All right, cool. We should link them up in the,

118
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,480
send me the link afterwards and I'll put it in the, in the show notes.

119
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:48,840
And I'll probably reach out to him and see if I can do anything with him on the podcast.

120
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,520
Yeah, now all of those things are very true.

121
00:08:51,520 --> 00:09:00,360
And I think what's got to know is something that's starting to get a little more traction is the idea of purchasing power parity pricing.

122
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,440
It's always hard to say with the idea.

123
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,160
The idea being that depending on where you live,

124
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:13,960
they will geofence the content, but you will pay a smaller and lower amount based on where you

125
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:19,560
live. Somebody that's really great with this is something like Kenzie Dodds. He's got all those

126
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:25,960
courses about React and testing and all that kind of stuff. And if I living in South Africa,

127
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:31,000
purchase is one of these courses, I get a 60% discount immediately just because of

128
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:37,240
but it's just very deep pricing. So I think that's something that the industry as a whole should

129
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:43,400
consider more widely is then they can make it because I understand what people lost money for

130
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:49,000
course. They take up a lot of work and if you want to do it well, it's especially a lot of work.

131
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:57,480
And for some people this is how they make a living. But it is tough when you come from a

132
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,800
a third-world country, or you're just starting out and you're still finding your feet and

133
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,200
you don't have a bunch of money to invest yet, it is hard.

134
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,720
And these all kinds of other interesting things developing around that idea as well, with

135
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,240
some academies and stuff in the United States exploring it up from my paying for your courses.

136
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,960
But that is evidently, I think the thing that I get from you is that one big thing that's

137
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:26,880
missing is a roadmap that you can look at, which points you at specific learning material

138
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:34,000
based on where you are along your path. And also which path you're on, are you on a back-end

139
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,280
path or you're on a full stack path or you're more in a front-end path because you'll have different

140
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:44,560
milestones and different learning material needs there. So I think that is something that

141
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,360
we should look into. See if there are some resources to help there.

142
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,240
Yeah, no, definitely because being in the front end developer, I've been working, learning,

143
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,240
and then I reach a point, and just look at everything online, what now?

144
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:06,880
Do I just invest my time into CSAs? Do I just continue HTML?

145
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,680
Java, what next? What do I need to do? What do I need to find?

146
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,240
So I end up spending two to three hours searching for stuff to learn,

147
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,560
running out of steam, learning for an hour or two, and then continuing with my day.

148
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,040
rather than having to go somewhere and spend those hours more,

149
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,320
an hour finding, this and this and this is what I need,

150
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,520
and then two to three hours of learning whatever needs to come next.

151
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:37,360
Yeah, yeah. I think, I think communities such as the Mycelium Network

152
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:44,560
can also help there, especially if we can get some more mentors to join our Discord server,

153
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,200
and then where we're talking about the idea of having some meetups virtually

154
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:55,360
and in person where it's possible. I think that'll help because there you can pose these

155
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:02,560
kind of questions and talk with other people and often, more often than not, somebody else's

156
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,960
being where you are and they can say, "Oh, I actually found this thing and it can kind of help

157
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:13,680
you on your way." So I think investing in community and joining it in on these communities and

158
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,960
being active, I think, is one of the ways that we can start solving this roadmap problem. But we

159
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:25,460
We have to get people from then on learning and people who are teaching in the same place.

160
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,780
A nice mixture of two.

161
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,020
So you don't have too many mentors in two little.

162
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,660
So yeah, definitely.

163
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,140
And it's quite a shy guy.

164
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,180
It's almost very difficult for me to enter the community.

165
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,180
Yes.

166
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:46,100
I don't know why I've always had this thing about online communities, even during my usually

167
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,140
hours and I have gaming and stuff.

168
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,380
I would not communicate with people in the server.

169
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,420
I just find it strange, you can say.

170
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,660
So that was quite different for me.

171
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:59,900
But what I found is you just jump in, find one thing you like,

172
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,860
just drop a comment and see what happens.

173
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:07,540
Yes, after that first comment, you find it's actually not that intimidating or scary.

174
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,820
You can just go.

175
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,020
Yeah, that's very true.

176
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,580
And a lot of that comes down to also the people running the community, right?

177
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:22,540
If you're focused and you start off with good community guidelines and you clearly enforce them,

178
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:28,700
it helps a lot because there are, you know, bundles out there that just want to come and

179
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:36,300
you know, sour the pot. But as long as there's people that have their finger on the pulse and

180
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,980
can quickly pick that up and make sure that those people aren't either kicked or

181
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:45,820
We're at the moment in a way that they understand that that kind of behavior is not welcome and

182
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:51,580
their continued participation is going to hinge very heavily on them changing their attitude.

183
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:57,580
I think that is important and it's something that unfortunately has been a little rough on the

184
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:04,540
internet, but mildly. Places got very toxic very quickly and for me and you it might be a little

185
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:11,660
bit easier than for some agendas and people of different races and ethnicities. For them,

186
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:18,300
it's even harder to really feel comfortable in these groups. So, you know, big challenges

187
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,220
that we have, but as long as we acknowledge them, then at least we're in the right direction.

188
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:27,100
I think you've mentioned a lot of, you've touched on a lot of the stuff from this, the next question

189
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:32,300
I had in mind, but I'm going to pose it anyway just in case there's anything else. So having talked

190
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:37,220
about all of these resources and stuff. So clearly there's a bunch of things that don't

191
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,940
work, but there are things that work. But if there's anything else that you feel on

192
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,140
that doesn't work to the great side that you want to highlight.

193
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:52,100
The work they're not works so great is a bit difficult. That's not works so great.

194
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,620
The only thing I'm personally really stuck on is feeling lost.

195
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,760
You just draw that falls into an ocean, you're just going to

196
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,620
dole swim.

197
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,220
You don't know where you're going.

198
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,260
You don't know which way you go.

199
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,220
No fish should swim down or up or what's going on.

200
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,020
That's the only thing that's really missing for me.

201
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,660
But that said, I do have you as a main source as well.

202
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,420
So I don't feel that lost.

203
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,380
If I get stuck, you can meet up and just say, I listen, this is going on.

204
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,100
Now can we resolve this?

205
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:21,740
Hmm.

206
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,020
Yeah, that's really that.

207
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,180
That's the important thing to have to nurture.

208
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,540
is this all made into a relationship?

209
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,260
Because I do think that there's a lot of value there.

210
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,180
But I think a lot of people miss.

211
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,580
Yeah, that's about to say that's definitely something

212
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:43,580
that's missing is finding someone you can ask a question to,

213
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,460
to just ask how do you had a hitting an HTML?

214
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,940
And not him having a law at you and just saying,

215
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,540
"Oh, okay, let's help you."

216
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,380
This is how we do it.

217
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,620
This is why we do it.

218
00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:00,220
But I did not feel that personally because I did start my journey with you.

219
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:05,860
So I had that from the get go, but I can really see that being missing in a lot of

220
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,380
people's startup you can often have same.

221
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:14,820
Yeah, yeah, no, for sure. That's true. I mean, I, I've been there also.

222
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:20,460
And I know that I, I actually searched widely to try and find is there any like

223
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:34,400
networks or mentorship programs or anything like that that you can join. And that there are some now, to be honest, that I should probably mention on, I'll put some of that links is some of them in the show notes.

224
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:44,820
Some stuff like outreach she is really, really great. And I also focus on being very inclusive. So, you know, it's outreach does some amazing work.

225
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,380
And there are some other mini-tourship programs as well.

226
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,980
But unfortunately, some of the mini-tourship things

227
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,420
again comes with a cost, which is understandable.

228
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,360
But again, if you're not in a position

229
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,300
to be able to pay, it is just another roadblock.

230
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,900
You have to face.

231
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:07,460
And even though web development, specifically,

232
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,940
that's what I can talk to mostly.

233
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,980
I've come a heck of a long way since the day

234
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:19,180
is when I started and a lot of things that used to be super hard are now trippily simple.

235
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:24,100
It's still not easy. There's still a lot of questions that one has. So, you know, the

236
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,300
need for that still exists very much.

237
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:33,380
I definitely don't. As for the roadblock of the payments, I have looked into teaching

238
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:41,580
myself, it's in general. So start up courses for all those people or

239
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:45,700
The women, especially in my area, don't really know how computers work.

240
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,700
That was a big thing for me.

241
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,860
A lot of female older women don't know in the area.

242
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,740
So I was looking to make something for them to teach you how computers work.

243
00:17:53,740 --> 00:18:00,300
And I completely understand why you charge so much for a course.

244
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,460
It's a lot of hard work.

245
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:07,180
It's a lot of information gathering and this and that and we need to remember this.

246
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:11,500
And even once I was ready to start, I still felt like I still have to go through

247
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:19,500
a couple of things and make sure. I can totally understand why, but not having the funds

248
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:25,740
necessarily available to pay, let's say, $60 for advanced courses you know will help you.

249
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:30,620
It's quite a hindrance because now I have to go search, how can I get this information for free?

250
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:39,020
Yeah, no, no, for sure, no, I completely, and the other thing with courses, of course, is that

251
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:44,380
you have to, especially if you're asking money, is you have to keep it up today. It's not

252
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:52,140
something you make and then forget about because the tech industry evolves and moves quite fast.

253
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:59,980
That's the other part. If you want to keep it, if you want it to be useful, you have to keep it up

254
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:07,340
today. That is something as well, because I was following books from Microsoft. I was lucky enough

255
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:14,460
to get access to those books and they fall into that trap. I would learn and learn and learn

256
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:20,300
and learn at some point and I'll hit a roadblock. It's being watched this. It's not working,

257
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,980
what's going on and I have to go search for hours and hours and hours just to find out.

258
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:29,260
This phrase is no longer valid. Simply change x to y and it works.

259
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:37,100
Yeah. So that is definitely a bit fool I can see some people falling into not keeping everything

260
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:43,020
up to date. And it is frustratingly to gain for us who is new at learning these things,

261
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:49,500
because now we, you would know this or no way to look for it, and it is paying two or three hours

262
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:56,380
to find out why they're not working. What's going on? What's this era? Yeah, for sure. But

263
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:01,660
seeing off the thing where you said you were looking at creating some courses to teach people

264
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:06,300
other skills that you already have, I think in general that is a good idea and that something

265
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:11,740
think that a lot of people knew to development. This doesn't matter what industry it is,

266
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:17,180
are a little bit scared of, but that I would personally encourage is to write about the stuff

267
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:23,820
that you learn because teaching is one of the best ways of learning. So if you've

268
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:30,620
if you've bolded something, anything, like write about what, write about how you made it,

269
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:35,660
doesn't necessarily have to tell a story per se about the struggles you had. It can not

270
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:39,460
So to just be you writing down how to make a responsive

271
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:44,500
year with HTML and CSS, because by doing that, you are

272
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,660
thinking through the process of having done that.

273
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,460
Oftentimes you find ways that you can do it even better than

274
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,380
what you've already done it.

275
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,540
So you automatically improve your existing code base.

276
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:58,740
And at the other day, you have a piece of writing that can also

277
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,940
be useful for whether you start a business or whether you're

278
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,140
looking for employment.

279
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,360
You have something to point people to you to say,

280
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,760
"Not only do I make this thing, but I wrote about our,

281
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,560
"I did it because there's not a lot of people

282
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,140
"that can do both of those things."

283
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,360
A lot of people are really good at writing the software,

284
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,040
but they're not so great at teaching it.

285
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,120
And what often they're not,

286
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,400
it's not that they don't have the skills,

287
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,080
they just never exercise that skill.

288
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,080
So as they exercise their coding skill,

289
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,320
they don't exercise writing about their coding.

290
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,480
And so that kind of never develops.

291
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,040
So you have this amazing software engineer,

292
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,880
but if you try to explain something to you,

293
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:40,880
It's like food right over your head because they'd never go back and think about how did I what did I do before I knew how to do this

294
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,880
How did I get to that point?

295
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:50,380
What was the things that I what were things I did wrong and how do I find a better way and stuff like that?

296
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:56,380
So I think while you're learning writing about the stuff that you make is incredibly important.

297
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:04,700
You just gave me a great idea to maybe branch off of my existing URL to start something to score

298
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:11,980
RWA is just journey. Just a place we can write. I made a navigation board today.

299
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:17,660
By using this, this and this. I hit this roadblock, but I found this information there.

300
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:23,180
So if someone does read it, they can say, "That's my problem." So I can just go look over there to

301
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:28,140
to go fix it. Yeah. Because something I hit a hard roadblock with is

302
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:32,420
including Jason into my project. So everyone is just like, no, just

303
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:37,020
added, just install it, just do it. Yeah, how, how do I do this?

304
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:41,580
And off like two or three hours, I was like, Oh, I just make a text

305
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:45,580
file change name and paste the stuff in and include it into my

306
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:51,420
job and bam, bod y'all. Yeah. Just that little bit of knowledge I

307
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:56,700
good and fine for about two to three hours because everyone just explains how to use it,

308
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,700
not how to implement it.

309
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,700
Gotcha.

310
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,700
Gotcha.

311
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,580
And it's literally because people just don't think that far back anymore.

312
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:08,420
For them using JSON is just a thing you do.

313
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,940
Like it's just text.

314
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,500
What are you talking about?

315
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:18,740
But it's like no, but if you don't know what JSON is and how it fits into the larger framework

316
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,820
of building a, let's take for example the one tool that I'd build,

317
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,940
developer toolchist.

318
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:29,140
All that is in the end of the day is a website that loads some JSON

319
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:33,980
that has a specific structure and loops through them.

320
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:37,820
And for each entry, it makes little block based on the search

321
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,940
filter that you typed in.

322
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:43,340
But if you don't know how JSON fits into that whole thing,

323
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,940
it can be like, wait, is, what is this JSON now?

324
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,340
Is it a database? It's like kind of.

325
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:49,640
Yeah.

326
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,140
Not really.

327
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:55,340
So, you know, it's it's understanding that no, Jason is just a flight text file that has

328
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,400
certain limitations placed upon it.

329
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:02,400
And Jason in the end is data.

330
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,280
So this is like the data part of your project.

331
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,480
You describe data inside your Jason document.

332
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,360
And then you can consume it as if it's like a database kind of just a very,

333
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,800
very loose database like, I don't know if you've ever looked up.

334
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:24,400
SQL Lite. But if you if you haven't doesn't manage just maybe after the podcast just have

335
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:30,800
a search for SQL Lite and SQL Lite is essentially just a flight Dix file on your hard drives that

336
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:38,400
it acts as a database. But you can query the data as if it's SQL that's why SQL Lite and like

337
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,440
it's in everything it's in everything like your mobile phone you're everything it's everywhere

338
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:50,640
see why it is like everywhere. Okay, I already opened a tab of the FF after we've done, so that's

339
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,320
one of those great reads. And that also reminded me that's something I see a lot of mentors

340
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:03,120
for, I want to say for short, but I don't know if that's the right word. That's why I like following

341
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:09,680
much. He says, "You're using H1 tag to edit title, and a lot of people just move on.

342
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,880
But for me personally, I want to know why.

343
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,880
What does it do? How does it work?

344
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,880
And what he does is he pulls up the graph and tells you,

345
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:22,880
"H1 does this. It has a title. It does this. This is how you use it. This is how you can use it."

346
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,880
So that is something I've been struggling with as well.

347
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,880
Because I've been following someone doing a text adventure game.

348
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,880
Because that was interesting to me.

349
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,880
This guy would just type, "No, use this. This is this. Enter."

350
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,880
And go to the next screen, like, "Way, why?

351
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,400
Why did you do this? How does this work?

352
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,000
You didn't explain to me anything.

353
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,480
You just wrote code on a little pad and moved on.

354
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,680
So he didn't actually teach me anything.

355
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,520
You just showed me what he can do.

356
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,600
Yeah, yeah.

357
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,840
And I guess there's a place for that.

358
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,680
But I think more often than not,

359
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,200
you find that a lot on Twitch.

360
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,680
Like a lot of people on Twitch would stream them working.

361
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,400
And the idea is not to...

362
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,400
You might pick up some stuff by watching,

363
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,640
but that's not their intent.

364
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:14,800
and intent is just like, I'm doing some stuff and maybe I want to be held accountable and therefore

365
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,120
I will stream every day between five and seven and I'll work on this specific project.

366
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,480
It's more a way of keeping themselves accountable and if somebody learns something out of it,

367
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,920
then great, but that's not the intent. But yeah, that's all good stuff. So I'm wondering,

368
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:36,720
so looking towards the future, then we're going to, I'm going to, it was two separate questions,

369
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,720
but I think we're going to throw it into one question.

370
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,720
- Okay.

371
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,720
- So, you can do one or two things.

372
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,720
Like you can learn and learn and eventually apply for a job

373
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,720
and work for somebody else.

374
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,720
Or you can do the other thing which is create your own

375
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,720
opportunity by starting your own business.

376
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,720
Whether that is building a product or starting an agency

377
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,720
where you create websites and design for other people.

378
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:09,760
But I think in both of those areas, it doesn't really matter which one you choose.

379
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,820
This idea of an interview as part of both.

380
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:18,640
The difference being, and the one at your interview for a specific position or the specific

381
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,440
company, the other one you're being interviewed by a client wants to know that if I give you

382
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,880
money, I'll get a website and return.

383
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,480
So therefore I need to, you know, I'm just not blindly going to give you money.

384
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,960
I want to speak to you a little bit.

385
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,200
and it's also a kind of an need to do.

386
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,640
So my question is, which one of the two

387
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,400
is of most interest to you, like starting a business

388
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,760
or working for somebody?

389
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:47,760
And based on that, what is the things about these interviews

390
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,160
that perhaps scare you a little bit?

391
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:54,720
- Okay, personally, I'd like to start my own business.

392
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,360
I walked out of high school into my permanent job,

393
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:03,360
working for about three years as a retail salesperson.

394
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,080
And after that, I got the opportunity

395
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,900
for better hours more pay doing school furrows.

396
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,400
So I've been working there for three years now as well.

397
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,320
So I've been basically working since I got out of high school.

398
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,160
And I've reached a point where I had enough

399
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,440
of making someone else rich.

400
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,400
I've got a lot of knowledge.

401
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,480
I've got a lot of experience with a lot of things.

402
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,720
I do feel like I've won a store-throwing thing.

403
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,040
and I want to get away from working for someone else.

404
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,640
On a start on our own business, I'm starting my own thing,

405
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,520
which I already have started.

406
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,280
I'm still looking for clients now.

407
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,920
I've got one-line bending.

408
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,360
We still need to do this interview you're talking about.

409
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,720
Yeah.

410
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,800
By having about three years with a sales experience,

411
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,560
the interviews are fun, but I look forward to it and it's exciting.

412
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,640
It's...

413
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,440
I can definitely see the scary bits of it,

414
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,160
having to explain to someone why to use you.

415
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,040
But what I always find in sales is,

416
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,320
if you use the term "fakety" make it,

417
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,960
you can sell a bin to a bin factory.

418
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,720
If you stand near the smile and they ask you,

419
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,880
"Can you do back end developments

420
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,720
and do this whole database thing?"

421
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,240
And tell them, "Yeah, sure.

422
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,520
"I do have to do some research.

423
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,760
"I do need to refresh an app on a couple of things,

424
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,880
"but let's talk, let's see what you can do."

425
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,040
and I'll tell you yes or no, I cannot, I cannot assist you.

426
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,960
Then the clients, most of them are more likely to use you

427
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,280
if you're honest about things like that.

428
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,480
'Cause they don't feel you're trying to scan them out of money,

429
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,320
they do feel like, okay, yeah, I do know what I'm doing.

430
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,280
I just need to sharpen up.

431
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,400
So then already feel like, oh, okay.

432
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,120
So you're not just someone looking for a quick buck,

433
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,960
you're actually interested in the work.

434
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,600
- Yeah, honesty goes a long way in business, that's true.

435
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:55,640
And I mean, I say that knowing full well that the business industry can be a bit of a

436
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,960
cutthroat industry as well.

437
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,840
But I think you have to have morals for yourself and for your business.

438
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:10,040
And like me personally, for me as well, I have very fine lines of the type of client I'd

439
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,320
be willing to work with.

440
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,240
And once I wouldn't be willing to work with it.

441
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,920
And I think there I'd shield myself a little bit from this cutthroat.

442
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,680
Like it would all about the money kind of thing.

443
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:24,240
Yeah, I think it's great. I think it's great to be honest and open that. Sure, I can do this.

444
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,080
This specific part of the project might be a little bit more challenging, but

445
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:33,520
you know, I have enough experience in how to find answers. That's what I do is I

446
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:39,520
find solutions to problem. The technology is almost kind of the easy part. Finding this

447
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,320
mentally finding a solution is

448
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:48,640
lots of times harder than actually writing the code. It's understanding why is the problem that the

449
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:55,440
the client's facing, how do I best solve this? And then what technology do I need to employ

450
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,800
and what it is to solve this? Because oftentimes people will come to you with a preconceived idea

451
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:05,200
in their head because they've heard it from a friend, but it might not necessarily be the best

452
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,000
solution for them. They might be something better that's come along since they're friend that

453
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,320
their thing. Their friend might actually also benefit from your services and because they might

454
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,880
I don't know that there's a better way to do this now.

455
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,160
They could actually save the money

456
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:24,000
or help them grow their business faster.

457
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,720
I'm always excited when I hear people

458
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,960
waiting to start their own businesses

459
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,520
because if we look at unemployment in the world,

460
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,760
they need for jobs as a massive.

461
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,640
And it is.

462
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,680
For each of us that starts our own little business

463
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,880
and start networking with each other,

464
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,160
we're creating opportunities for ourselves,

465
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,000
but down the line we're creating opportunities for others.

466
00:31:46,000 --> 00:32:05,000
And the nice thing about somebody like yourself, for example, sorting a business is you know the pain of having to learn this stuff and having to find a job where people say, oh, how much experience do you have while working experience not yet, but I've done all these and I know, no, no, we're looking for something five years experience.

467
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,720
So you'll be more open to listening to somebody and giving them a chance and telling them,

468
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,320
you know what can work?

469
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,720
I'll pay you a full salary for a month and let's see how it goes.

470
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,240
If by the end of the month I can see that you could do the job, what's your uncle and

471
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,800
let's just keep going.

472
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:28,560
But if I find that after a month that you can even struggle but if you're willing to

473
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:34,480
learn and you're willing to do what's necessary to get the work done, I'm happy to employ

474
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,320
you. I think the more that we can get that that kind of thing going, the better.

475
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:45,040
Yeah, and that's insane. That is something I find very difficult. I've been on a lot of platforms

476
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:50,880
like Upwork and so on looking for jobs. And I find stuff and I look at them like I can do this.

477
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,760
I can do everything you need. I have all the requirements. I've got the technology. I've got

478
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,480
the background. I've got internet connection. I've got all of this. The only thing I'm lacking

479
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:07,280
is a three years of experience I must have you're looking for. And finding that one person that says,

480
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:14,080
"Hey, listen, this is your opportunity. Just try, let's see what you can do." That's all you need.

481
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:20,000
That's all you need is that one guy that just says, "I'm willing to give you a month's worth of work.

482
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,240
Let's see what you're doing. How are you handling this?" On a little bit of a side tangent,

483
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:33,120
the interview just circling back to the interviews. I do have some advice with people. I turn it around.

484
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:40,400
If I have a client comes to me, I'm there. They can just find my wording. I am interviewing them.

485
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:47,200
Like, they need to tell me what they need. I get to tell them what they get to tell me what they

486
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,760
are looking for, what they are looking to do. So, they'll come to me sound three pages,

487
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,760
I want this time, I want that time, I want this day.

488
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,760
And we're like, okay, well, this I can do few.

489
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,760
This I can do few.

490
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,760
It's very difficult. It takes long.

491
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,760
So you are going to be charged more for this.

492
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,760
Because instead of just a quick hours with the work,

493
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,760
this can take me about three or four hours.

494
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,760
But I can do it another way for you.

495
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,760
So instead of sitting there and wondering like,

496
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,760
I'm being interviewed, I turn it around.

497
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,760
I ask them, what are you looking for?

498
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,560
What do you want? What do you want out of this website?

499
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:25,200
Because obviously I can say whatever I want.

500
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,280
And I might just go off an aside engine for an hour,

501
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,280
where it's just speaking about myself and what I did,

502
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,960
not answering any questions.

503
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,000
Where a fatalic work client, what's your question?

504
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,480
What's your next question and answer?

505
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,240
And you ask a question and say something like,

506
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,480
where does it come? This is not how it works.

507
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,560
We can't do it this way. We can do it this way, this way or this way.

508
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,500
clients love having options.

509
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:55,900
Yeah, so it's pretty much flipping to view around and you're interviewing them now.

510
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:59,680
Because at the end of the day, you do need to know from them what you need to do.

511
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,520
Oh, yes.

512
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,400
And having that person just ask you the entire time, what do you want?

513
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,480
What are you looking for?

514
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,080
Yes, I can do this for you.

515
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,280
No, I cannot do this for you.

516
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,280
Feels a lot easier than I sell websites.

517
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,000
I make websites to go look over the air.

518
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,120
I can make an navigation board.

519
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:20,620
I can, then you change it all from me, me to them.

520
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:23,880
And you change the focus point around on them.

521
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,560
And I feel very special if I can state it like that.

522
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,560
- Yeah, no for sure.

523
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,120
No, that's great advice.

524
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,800
Yeah, thank you for sharing that.

525
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,760
This was really cool.

526
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,440
I really enjoyed this.

527
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,840
I'm looking forward to seeing where you go

528
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,040
and what you do with your business.

529
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,720
So before we officially wrap it up,

530
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:55,020
Is there any projects you're currently working on that you like to tell everybody about this can be open source can be site projects as matter client projects that you can talk about.

531
00:35:55,020 --> 00:36:06,820
Or any like leads that you'd like people to to know about and of course we'll have them all also in the show notes but if you want to give some specific shout outs then go for it.

532
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:14,040
Not quite at the moment, I do have a client outstanding that it is going everything points

533
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,440
on our going to use me to create the website.

534
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:22,840
They do work with aluminium and door frames and they install them for different houses

535
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:26,840
all around our area in Bratoria.

536
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:30,400
So I will love to share that journey, like you said.

537
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,440
I would like to make a blog for a journey of how I will create that.

538
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,980
But as of now, I still need all the information.

539
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:41,220
So I haven't started yet, but I have started planning.

540
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:44,940
I have started looking at designs and callous skins

541
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,420
and stuff like that.

542
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:50,780
The only current project I do have is my own website,

543
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:55,580
which is rwiswebdesign.co.z/a.

544
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,620
It is currently live.

545
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:59,500
I have been communicating with our community,

546
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,100
improving some stuff, changing grammar,

547
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,620
updating some of my graphics.

548
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:09,860
And I do keep it up to date because this will be my private business website from yarn on.

549
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,360
>> Yeah.

550
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,200
>> Yeah.

551
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,040
>> That's great.

552
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:16,420
>> Can you just repeat that URL for us?

553
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,260
>> That's rwas.

554
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:21,260
Webdesign.co.z.

555
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,560
>> Okay.

556
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,540
rwas.co.z.

557
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,660
Webdesign.co.z.

558
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,260
I get you check it out, folks.

559
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:32,500
So other than that, the site projects I don't really have at the moment, I would like to

560
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,940
give a shout out to freecodecamp.org.

561
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,540
You actually gave me this side a bit earlier,

562
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,500
this recap thing.

563
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:44,820
And it's an amazing platform so far for me to learn.

564
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,700
They do start from their very basics, which

565
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,580
is a bit annoying.

566
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,540
They got about four or five exercises in,

567
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:53,300
and they've already told me something new of the basics.

568
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,380
I didn't know.

569
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:58,860
So far, it feels like an amazing tutorial,

570
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,420
especially for beginners to start it,

571
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,100
because they start some bull easy to understand.

572
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:06,260
They've got documentation, all of that good things.

573
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,900
- Yeah, and the great thing about pre-code camp is,

574
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:12,180
well, it's free, but beyond that,

575
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:15,460
it's built by a community of contributors.

576
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:20,540
So one, it's kept up to date, constantly being improved

577
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:23,900
and you yourself, like Dikku, that's learning,

578
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,860
you can contribute back to that project,

579
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,340
even if it's just a small thing

580
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,340
where you may be fine the wording of something

581
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,940
as understandable as you'd like to be.

582
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,180
It's an open source project.

583
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,540
You can fork it open a pull request

584
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,540
and propose something that you feel would improve it.

585
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:41,540
So I think it's a really great to be involved

586
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,740
with projects like that.

587
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,940
And as one of the other ones tonight,

588
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:44,940
I'll give a shout out to you

589
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,540
because I'm quite involved with them.

590
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,140
That is in the same vein.

591
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,340
It's an open source project.

592
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,740
All the content is right there.

593
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,140
It's community written.

594
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,940
There are some people paid to work on it.

595
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,540
But it's a massive open source project.

596
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:00,780
So I think being involved in these projects is great.

597
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:07,060
And there's a lot of wonderful people behind these projects that would be happy to receive

598
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:12,980
full requests. So I can like personally send an invitation to everybody listening to both

599
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:19,100
go check out Fiko Camp and MDN Web docs on GitHub and on the web and learn contribute.

600
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:23,700
It's all good. It's all learning experience. So yeah, thanks for sharing that.

601
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:30,500
Yeah. So yeah, no, there is something I would like to go back and actually donate to free camp,

602
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:37,700
free code camp, if not if when my business takes off. When I become a success, I would love to go

603
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:41,780
back and actually donate to them. And that is something I am very appreciative of them.

604
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:49,060
They don't cap their learning based on how you get. You do a orbussy working and pops out like,

605
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,580
like, "Hey, listen, would you like to donate?"

606
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,580
I just look ashamed, like, "No, not now.

607
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:58,780
Maybe once my first site takes off and I've made my first sale, I'll come back and

608
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,300
I'll come donate on here."

609
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,620
I've totally done that.

610
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:08,860
I've totally done that with a couple of open source things where it's been just like,

611
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,820
I wouldn't be where I am without it.

612
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:15,660
And so now that I am where I am, I totally just go and do a monthly, like set up a monthly

613
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:21,500
donation because I wanted to be around for the next generation and I wanted to keep improving.

614
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:28,140
So yeah, I think that's great that that you're also already preparing yourself for doing that

615
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:33,740
this great stuff. Well, thanks Rico. It was really great. Thanks for being the first guest on the

616
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:40,380
My CDM network podcast. I hope this is going to be one of many many many and we'll do one again once

617
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,500
Once your business is huge and you've got like hundreds of employees.

618
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:49,500
That's been great. Thank you for having me. It's been quite an experience. Always nice to

619
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:53,740
sit and speak to someone about these kind of things. Yeah, I've not just sitting in your own mind

620
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:59,740
just thinking about all of this stuff and just feeling stuck. So I would actually recommend it for

621
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:03,580
shy people as well. Get a community, join a community and just start speaking with people.

622
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:08,060
It really lightens the load if you say it like that.

623
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:11,020
Yeah, I'm sure it's been quite a patient.

624
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:13,260
Same for me.

625
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:17,580
